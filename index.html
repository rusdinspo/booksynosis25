<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Nothing Like the Sun</h2><p><p><strong>Before <em>Shakespeare in Love</em>, there was Anthony Burgess's <em>Nothing Like the Sun</em>: a magnificent, bawdy telling of Shakespeare's love life.</strong></p></p><p>Anthony Burgess (1917&#x2013;1993) is the author of many works, including The Wanting Seed, Nothing Like the Sun, and Re Joyce. A Clockwork Orange is one of the "100 best novels" of both Time magazine and Modern Library and is on David Bowie's Book List.&#x201c;Implicitly, Burgess is making the case that Shakespeare's talent had its origin in his sexual drives and that his topless towers of words were founded on his immense desire and will. Fascinated but resistant, I reread the sonnets and found that the novel illuminated them so much as to justify his case. This is to me a measure of Burgess's talents--that he can remake reality not only in his own writing but also in a new perception of the writings of his subject.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Shakespeare [is shown] in his own stirring times. . . . A brilliant book. . . . Taut and forceful.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Aileen Pippett, <em>Times Literary Supplement [London]</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Nothing Like the Sun</em> is a wildly inventive, verbally dazzling attempt to enter the secret chambers of Shakespeare's inner life. Cunning, alert, and deliciously irresponsible, Burgess brilliantly invents a private history of sexual desire and betrayal lurking behind the blank face that looks out from the First Folio.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Stephen Greenblatt</strong></p><h2>What is Obscenity?: The Story of a Good For Nothing Artist and her Pussy</h2><p><p>A graphic memoir of a good-for-nothing Japanese artist who has been jailed twice for so-called acts of obscenity and the distribution of pornographic materials yet continues to champion the art of pussy. In a society where one can be censored, pixelated, and punished, Rokudenashiko asks what makes pussy so problematic?</p><p><b>Rokudenashiko </b>("good-for-nothing girl") is a Japanese artist. She is known for her series of decorated vulva moulds, or "Decoman," a portmanteau of decorated and <i>manko</i>, slang for vagina. Distributing a 3D scan of her genitalia to crowdfunding supporters led to her arrest for alleged violation of Japanese obscenity laws.</p></p><p>Rokudenashiko ("good-for-nothing girl" or "bad girl") is a Japanese sculptor and <i>mangaka</i>. She is known for her series of decorated vulva moulds, or "Deco-man," a portmanteau of "decorated" and "<i>manko</i>," which is Japanese slang for vagina. The moulds have taken the shape of dioramas, <i>kawaii</i> characters and a kayak based on a 3D scan of her genitalia, which she dubbed the "pussy boat." Distributing the 3D scan to crowdfunding supporters led to her arrest in 2014 for alleged violation of Japanese obscenity laws. Her work is noted for challenging Japanese perceptions of female sexuality through taboo skewering humour and wit.<strong><em>L.A. Times</em> Book Prize Finalist</strong><br><br>"Rokudenashiko's <em>What Is Obscenity</em> is jam-packed with great ideas and horrifying but hilarious stories." - Rob Clough, <em>High-Low</em><br><br>"The comics here are straightforward and highly amusing, and her story is utterly incredible." - Robert Boyd, <em>The Comics Journal</em><br><br>"Not only is this book hilarious...it's also thoughtful and wrenching." - Rebecca, Librairie Drawn &amp; Quarterly<br><br>"Rokudenashiko's outside-the-box story will fascinate adults interested in censorship, feminism, and their own bodies." - <em>Library Journal</em><br><br>"At times horrifying, outrageous and inspiring, the artist finds strength and power in the most adorable forms, and never stops smiling at the serious, small men determined to take her down." - Priscilla Frank, <em>The Huffington Post</em><br><br>"a pioneering feminist work" - Tom Batten, <em>Library Journal</em><br><br>"Rokudenashiko has taken the pussy away from the realm of male desire, which has ironically lead her art to be considered <em>'obscene.'</em>" - Jonny Gottlieb, <em>GAYLETTER</em><br><br>"In the beautifully-illustrated memoir, which is anything but crude, Igarashi recalls growing up in a country where the penis is celebrated, but to even say the word vagina, or <em>manko</em>, is considered obscene." - Sarah Cascone, <em>artnet news</em><br><br>"The manga's cutesy, utterly non-pornographic style, like that of Igarashi's sculptures, gets her point across so beautifully ... and in the process renders the charges of obscenity even more absurd." - Carey Dunne, <em>Hyperallergic</em><br><br>"We need Rokudenashiko as much in the U.S. as in Japan." - Mia Nakaji Monnier, <em>Electric Lit</em><br><br>"Though her time in jail is short, her uncertainly about how to navigate the arbitrary rules of the guards - which cover everything from the way chopsticks are returned in a bento box to the manner in which a package is torn - make for a fascinating addition to prison literature." - Michael Melgaard, <em>The Millions</em><br><br>"<em>What Is Obscenity? </em>is a must-read piece of comics activism, telling the disturbing true story of a female artist punished by her country for celebrating a natural part of being a woman." - Oliver Sava, <em>A.V. Club</em><br><br>"Rokudenashiko tells the story of her arrest in a funny, engaging, and eye-opening way." - Rich Barrett, <em>mental_floss</em><br><br>"So rest assured, this is a highly entertaining and moving memoir. But it's also a wonderful look at the standards that go into defining what is obscene, and the struggles that an artist has to go through in order to be able to express themselves properly." - Sean Gaffney, <em>A Case Suitable for Treatment</em><br><br>"[W]hile [Rokudenashiko's] experience is thoroughly Japanese, there should be enough hooks for Western readers to look questioningly at their own cultural mores. Solid work and highly recommended." - Seth T. Hahne, "75 Best Comics By Women," <em>GoodOkBad</em><br><br>"<em>What Is Obscenity?</em> is a fantastic memoir manga that describes the artist's time in jail as well as her own artistic process." - Michelle Martinez, <em>New York Journal of Books</em><br><br>"Despite the understandable outrage, despite the big issues that her experience tackles, despite corruption and misogyny and incompetence she faced, despite the gloominess of prison and her own emotional traumas, she still puts it together in a form that is extremely personable even as it informs. She is the best possible messenger." - John Seven, <em>The Comics Beat</em><br><br>"Megumi Igarashi's [Rokudenashiko's] story is enough to make you scream out from the injustice." - Sophie Knight, <em>The Japan Times</em><br><br>"<em>What Is Obscenity?</em> is groundbreaking manga...a brave, powerfully subversive political document." - Robert Kirby, <em>The Comics Journal</em><br><br>"Rokudenashiko is a one-woman revolution. Her brilliance is profane yet innocent, which is a sign of true genius. I'm moved and laughing and crying and angry and overjoyed by her work. Her greatness is overwhelming and right on time." - Margaret Cho<br><br>"This effortlessly sincere graphic novel is soon to be a classic. Rokudenashiko's story is one of frustration and a great reminder of the work that still needs to be done. It will remain an important part of the international feminist dialogue until the end of time." - JD Samson<br><br>"Rokudenashiko is so brave! Her work shows how powerful humor and cuteness can be to affect social change. MANKO FOREVER!" - Jillian Tamaki<br><br> "Rokudenashiko's brave and adorable vagina-inspired Manko art has the power to terrify grown men, fight for artistic freedom, and make feminists everywhere proud." - Jennifer Camper<br><br>"Even while dealing with some fairly serious issues, <em>What Is Obscenity?</em> is sweet and charming with a wonderful sense of humor and art to match. As with much of Rokudenashiko's work, <em>What Is Obscenity?</em> can be silly and fun, though many of the events portrayed were probably not nearly as funny while she was actually living through them." - Ash Brown, <em>Experiments in Manga</em><br><br>"This book is a manga essay written from the epicenter of the controversy, by the artist Rokudenashiko (?) and in a full-frontal tone the artist asks the world, 'what is obscenity?' This book is crucial to understanding who exactly Rokudenashiko is, before getting consumed in 'arguing for the sake of arguing' about her so-called crimes." - Bijutsu Techo, <em>Art Handbook</em><br><br>"This is actually a feel-good memoir. It's also crucial reading for understanding the problems with the obscure methods of the Japanese police's handling of suspects, and while that makes the book sound plenty stiff, the author's sense of humor make this an outrageously fun read. Setting aside the main gist of the book, the author's piquant tone and 'do what you have to, to do you!' attitude is sure to motivate many readers." - <em>MUSIC MAGAZINE</em> <br><br>"Rokudenashiko's works pose a very good opportunity to rethink the way this country has dealt with the idea of gender and how it defines obscenity." - Shukan Jitsuwa, <em>First-Hand Accounts Weekly</em><br><br>&#x201c;Rokudenashiko&#x2019;s <em>What Is Obscenity?</em> is a book that will resonate with fans of autobiographical comics and civil rights alike.&#x201d; &#x2015; Amelia Basol, <em>Rain Taxi</em><br><br>&#x201c;The book is alternately charming, informative, and enraging; Igarashi&#x2019;s cute drawing style opens us up to her plight and in between the brief prison stories are photos, informative essays and interviews that contextualize many of the concepts discussed.&#x201d; &#x2015; Klon Waldrip, <em>Diabolique Magazine</em><br><br></p><h2>Suki Schorer on Balanchine Technique</h2><p>A highly detailed book on Balanchine technique, written by one of his former principal dancers, now a leading teacher at the School of American Ballet. <br><br>When still a young dancer in the New York City Ballet, Suki Schorer was chosen by Balanchine to lecture, demonstrate, and teach--he recognized in her that rare dancer who not only performs superbly but can also successfully pass along what she knows to others. Now, she commits to paper the fruit of her twenty-four-year collaboration with Balanchine in a close examination of his technique for teachers, scholars, and advanced students of the ballet. <br><br>Schorer discusses the crucial work at the barre as well as center work, port de bras, pointework, jumps, partnering, and more. Her recollections of her own tutelage under Balanchine and her brilliant use of scores of his remarks about dancing and dancers lend both authority and intimacy to this extraordinary analysis of Balanchine's legacy to the future of dance. <br><br>Profusely illustrated throughout with instructional photographs featuring members of the New York City Ballet, this book will serve as an indispensable testament to Balanchine's ideas on technique and performance.<br><b>From the Preface</b><br><br>At Balanchine's instigation I began to teach in the early 1960s while still a member of the corps de ballet . . . One day, as I was adjusting a tendu front in a class of nine-year-olds, Balanchine walked into the studio with Lincoln Kirstein, the school's longtime president. As they left, I heard Mr. B say to Lincoln, "I knew she would get down on the floor and fix feet . . ."<br><br>I believed in Balanchine. Seeing and then dancing in his ballets made me believe in his aesthetic. Sharing the life of his company and school made me believe in his approach to work and to life in general. In my teaching, in my lectures, in my writing, and in videos on the technique, I have tried to convey not only his aesthetic, but also his beliefs about how to work, how to deal with each other, and how to live . . .<br><br>My purpose in writing this book is to record what I learned from him about ballet dancing and teaching ballet, insofar as that is possible on paper . . . By helping others deepen their understanding of Balanchine's art, I hope to contribute in a small way to the preservation of his unique and extraordinary legacy.</p><p>George Balanchine, world-renowned choreographer and founder of the New York City Ballet, made a tremendous impact on the history of American dance by ushering in the era of neoclassical ballet defined by spartan costumes, technical wizardry, and a new musicality. No less important was his immense impact on generations of his dancers. Mr. B demanded an incredible commitment from his dancers, both physically and personally. Many became lifelong devotees with a continuing commitment to his ideas even after his death in 1983. Suki Schorer has dedicated her life to Mr. B's method of dancing. A former ballerina with the NYCB and currently a teacher of advanced students at the School of American Ballet, the official school of the NYCB, Schorer lives, breathes, and sleeps Balanchine's teachings. Balanchine dancers are instantly recognizable, as their technique differs rather significantly from that of other schools. With a teaching style that is her own (she is known for her unrelenting enthusiasm), Schorer translates what she learned from Mr. B for her students and readers of this book. In this technical manual aimed at advanced students and their teachers, Schorer peppers the ballet instruction with stories and anecdotes of her experiences with the great choreographer. The 415 pages and 700 black-and-white photographs of five NYCB dancers demonstrating the ballet instruction are a real testament to how much one has to learn before donning a black leotard and pink tights and dancing to Stravinsky. <i>--J.P. Cohen</i>Suki Schorer danced with George Balanchine&#39;s New York City Ballet from 1959 to 1972. She teaches at the School of American Ballet, the official school of the New York City Ballet.</p><h2>Ramona the Brave</h2><p>Six-year-old Ramona Quimby can&#39;t wait to begin first grade.

The two Roman provinces of Upper and Lower Germany were the result of that defeat of the Roman Limitation of , . _^ Roman o�r- arms and ot Koman policy under the reign of Augustus which has been already (p. 60 f.) described. The original province of Germany, which embraced the country from the Rhine to the Elbe, subsisted only twenty years, from the first campaign of u. Drusus, 742 u.c., down to the battle of Varus ^ d 9 and the fall of Aliso, 762 u.c. ; but as, on the one hand, it included the military camps on the left bank of the Rhine--Vindonissa, Mogontiacum, Vetera--and, on the other hand, even after that disaster, more or less considerable portions of the right bank remained Roman, the governorship and the command were not, in a strict sense, done away by that catastrophe, although they were, so to speak, placed in suspense. The internal organisation of the Three Gauls has been already set forth ; they embraced the whole country as far as the Rhine without distinction of descent--except that the Ubii, who had only been brought over to settle in Gaul during the last crises, did not belong to the sixty-four cantons, while the Helvetii, the Triboci, and generally the districts elsewhere held in occupation by the Rhenish troops, doubtless did so belong. The intention had been to gather together the German cantons between the Rhine and Elbe into a similar association under Roman supremacy, as had been constituted in the case of the Gallic cantons, and to bestow upon it, in the altar to Augustus of the Ubian town--the germ of the modern Cologne--an executive centre similar to that which the altar of Augustus of Lyons formed for Gaul; for the more remote future the transference of the chief camp to the right bank ...</p><p>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>In a Class by Itself</h2><p>One of romance's most beloved authors, Sandra Brown creates love stories of unsurpassed passion and emotion.

For the uninitiated, she introduces the artists' work--from Rothko's ``soft-edged'' rectangles to Still's ``grand-size, craggy canvases'' and the painted ``skeins and puddles'' of Pollock (``our first media-made American artist'')-- and covers their private lives as well: problems with drinking, overbearing mothers, strained marriages, Gottlieb's sharp clothes, and Still's canvas-cluttered guest room. ``Abstract expressionism arrived with the atomic age,'' Kingsley points out. But the implicit promise of placing the movement into the larger context of N.Y.C. at midcentury, and of the country at the time of McCarthy and the Korean War, is only scantily met. The close-up view of 1950 proves it to have been a crucial year, particularly in bringing this new art to the public, but the calendar-based format loses logical thread as it delves into one artist, then another, moving backward and forward in time, bringing up psychology, criticism, and other aspects of this internally driven art. An informative, sometimes vivid, anecdotal survey that shies away from breakthrough interpretations of the artistic revolution staged almost 50 years ago. (Photographs--including eight pages of color--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>This vibrant, intimate, gripping group portrait of American Abstract Expressionists shows how the anguish of their personal lives fed into their art. Kingsley, a Manhattan-based art critic and curator, focuses on 1950, the pivotal "year of greatest interaction" among Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko and their associates, and the only year when they all lived and worked together in New York City. Their circle included the near-destitute Franz Kline, whose wife spent 14 years in a mental hospital; Robert Motherwell, who oscillated between "atavistic caveman" and Francophile sophisticate; sculptor David Smith, prone to domestic violence and abuse of women; and the mordantly romantic Arshile Gorky, whose wife left him shortly after an auto accident in which he suffered a broken neck and a paralyzed painting arm. Despite the outward differences between Pollock's famous drips and Barnett Newman's vertical "zip," these artists shared a desire to let content emerge directly from the psyche and a "desperation to speak through the medium of paint alone."

Shiller, a leading expert on market volatility, evokes Alan Greenspan&#x2019;s infamous 1996 reference, &#x201c;irrational exuberance,&#x201d; to explain the alternately soaring and declining stock market. Shiller&#x2019;s unconventional yet persuasive argument credits an unprecedented confluence of events with driving stocks to uncharted heights, and he analyzes the structural, cultural, and psychological factors behind these levels of growth not reflected in any other sector of the economy. Now more relevant than ever, this analysis is both chilling and convincing&#x2014;a must-read for the individual investor, the policy maker, and the investment professional.</p><p>CNBC, day trading, the Motley Fool, Silicon Investor--not since the 1920s has there been such an intense fascination with the U.S. stock market. For an increasing number of Americans, logging on to Yahoo! Finance is a habit more precious than that morning cup of joe (as thousands of SBUX and YHOO shareholders know too well). Yet while the market continues to go higher, many of us can't get Alan Greenspan's famous line out of our heads. In <i>Irrational Exuberance</i>, Yale economics professor Robert J. Shiller examines this public fascination with stocks and sees a combination of factors that have driven stocks higher, including the rise of the Internet, 401(k) plans, increased coverage by the popular media of financial news, overly optimistic cheerleading by analysts and other pundits, the decline of inflation, and the rise of the mutual fund industry. He writes: "Perceived long-term risk is down.... Emotions and heightened attention to the market create a desire to get into the game. Such is irrational exuberance today in the United States."<p> By history's yardstick, Shiller believes this market is grossly overvalued, and the factors that have conspired to create and amplify this event--the baby-boom effect, the public infatuation with the Internet, and media interest--will most certainly abate. He fears that too many individuals and institutions have come to view stocks as their only investment vehicle, and that investors should consider looking beyond stocks as a way to diversify and hedge against the inevitable downturn. This is a serious and well-researched book that should read like a Stephen King novel to anyone who has staked his or her future on the market's continued success. --<i>Harry C.

In [this book], Leon Wolff tells the full story, revealing how and why the U.S. went from aiding Filipino independence to forcefully annexing the islands for themselves. Combining rich historical knowledge with a compelling narrative style, Wolff offers a masterful portrait of the insurrection, including revealing sketches of key figures such as U.S. governor-general William H. Taft and Filipino leader Emilio Aquinaldo. In addition, he provides a memorable look at the fierce debate raging back home. On the side of the empire were the nation&#39;s leading Republicans, including President William McKinley, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, and New York&#39;s famously pugnacious governor, Theodore Roosevelt, who declared that &#39;the clamor of the peace faction has convinced me that the country needs a war.&#39; On the opposing side stood an equally influential group, including labor leader Samuel Gompers, industrialist Andrew Carnegie, and celebrated author Mark Twain, all of whom joined the Anti-Imperialist League.

Worsley was the captain of the H.M.S. Endurance, the ship used by the legendary explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton in his 1914-16 expedition to the Antarctic. On its way to the Antarctic continent the Endurance became trapped and then crushed by ice, and the ship's party of twenty-eight drifted on an ice floe for five months. Finally reaching an uninhabited island, Shackleton, Worsley, and four others sailed eight hundred miles in a small boat to the island of South Georgia, an astounding feat of navigation and courage. All hands survived this ill-fated expedition; as Worsley writes, "By self-sacrifice and throwing his own life into the balance, [Shackleton] saved every one of his men . . . although at times it had looked unlikely that one could be saved." "This remarkable book . . . shows [Shackleton] both luckless and lucky, and supremely cool and courageous throughout. Worsley writes without heroics . . . but makes us feel to the marrow the conditions that the party endured before all hands were rescued."&#x2014;The New Yorker&nbsp; "Worsley's account of that journey is a breath-taking story of courage, skill and determination under the most appalling conditions."&#x2014;Sir Edmund Hillary</p><p>A native New Zealander, Frank A. Worsley served as a reserve officer in the Royal Navy before becoming captain of the Endurance. He commanded two ships in World War I, for which he was decorated, sailed with Shackleton again in 1921, and in 1925 was the joint leader of the British Arctic Exploration. Worsley died in 1943."The Weddell Sea might be described as the Antarctic extension of the South Atlantic Ocean. Near the southern extreme of the Weddell Sea in 77� south latitude Shackleton's ship Endurance, under my command, was beset in heavy pack ice. The temperature in February fell to 53� of frost - an unusually cold snap for the southern summer of 1914-15. <p>"The pack ice froze into a solid mass. We were unable to free the ship and she drifted northwest, 1,000 miles during the summer, autumn, and winter. The Endurance was crushed, and sank in 69� S. </p><p>"Our party of twenty-eight - eleven scientists and seventeen seamen - camped on the floes in lightweight tents through which the sun and moon shone and the blizzards chilled us. Our main food supply consisted of seals and penguins. So the ice, with its human freight, crept northwards - 600 miles in five months." </p><p>These are the dramatic opening words of Frank Worsley's gripping adventure story, hardly hinted at by his book's unassuming title, Shackleton's Boat Journey. Worsley was the captain of the Endurance, and the matter-of-fact tone that pervades this book serves to heighten rather than diminish the astounding accomplishments of Ernest Shackleton and his crew, who were attempting an Antarctic Expedition. </p><p>When the Endurance became trapped, the task of the expedition changed from one of exploration to one of survival. Manning the three lifeboats, the crew attempted to reach land, but their way was blocked by the same sort of ice that had just crushed the Endurance. They were forced to set up camp on giant ice floes, and remained drifting for five months. (Worsley charted the drift, and if they moved toward Elephant Island, he was praised, if they did not, he was cursed.) They faced the cold, killer whales, and despair, but the greatest danger was that of losing a man in the water: </p><p>"The nor'west swell rolled our ice floe to and fro, rocking us gently to sleep. Slowly the floe swung round until it was end on to the swell. The watchmen, discussing the respective merits of seal brains and livers, ignored this challenge of the swell. At 11 P.M. a larger undulation rolled beneath, lifting the floe and cracking it across under the seamen's tent. We heard a shout, and rushing out found their tent was tearing in halves - one half on our side and half on the other side of the crack." </p><p>In spite of the darkness, Sir Ernest, by some instinct, knew the right spot to go to. He found Holness - like a full-grown Moses - in his bag in the sea. Sir Ernest leaned over, seized the bag and, with one mighty effort, hove man and bag up on to the ice. Next second the halves of the floe swung together in the hollow of the swell with a thousand-ton blow. </p><p>The first part of Worsley's book chronicles the final push to the nearest land, Elephant Island, situated in the Antarctic Archipelago that reaches out into the South Sea. Shackleton then made the decision to take five men with him in one of the boats and try for South Georgia Island, a journey of over 800 miles of open sea. Worsley was chosen for his navigational skills. The latter part of the book describes their sixteen days at sea and arrival at the uninhabited side of the island. Shackleton, Worsley and Crean were forced to make a further push inland over dangerous mountainous terrain in order to reach help. </p><p>What enabled the men to persevere? Not just the incredible courage, humor, and dedication to one another that they displayed, but also an innate sense of how decent men behave. To get the entire picture of Worsley's character, however, you have to read Shackleton's account of the adventure in South (available from The Narrative Press); Worsley is too modest to put himself forward. This is an exceptional story.</p></p><h2>To Bedlam and Part Way Back</h2><p>V/G to LIKE NEW CONDITION. 1960 Houghton Mifflin trade paperback,10th printing. Anne Sexton (The Complete Poems).

This mysterious land, now a province of the People's Republic of China, has produced some of the most fascinating and creative art in the world. From silk embroidery and textiles to painting, sculpture, and manuscripts, Tibetan art has striking qualities that set it apart from other Buddhist and Asian art. Robert Fisher takes the reader through the history of Tibetan art, starting from its origins in the early days of the Tibetan kingdom. From a bleak and often inaccessible landscape arose a religious and artistic world so vibrant and sophisticated that even China's emperors commissioned works. The art and spiritual life of the region are inextricably intertwined, and Dr. Fisher explores the distinctive character of that relationship. Careful attention is also given to ritual objects, which comprise some of the most important works of art in Tibetan culture. 180 illustrations, 93 in colror</p><p></p><h2>The Baby-Sitter II (Point Horror Series)</h2><p>Recovered from an earlier brush with death, Jenny finds a new baby-sitting job, but when the phone rings one night, her nightmare begins all over again</p><p></p><h2>Needlelace: Designs and Techniques Classic and Contemporary</h2><p>This is a progressive instruction course for those already familiar with the basics of this type of lace design.

Its very name evokes images of almost superhuman courage, endurance, and fighting spirit. But until now, the story of what happened at Marathon has been told exclusively through the narrow viewpoint of specialists in antiquity. In this eye-opening new book, acclaimed journalist Jim Lacey, both a military historian and a combat veteran, takes a fresh look at Marathon and reveals why the battle happened, how it was fought, and whether, in fact, it saved Western civilization.<br> <br>Lacey brilliantly reconstructs the world of the fifth century B.C. leading up to the astonishing military defeat of the Persian Empire by the vastly undermanned but determined Greek defenders. Using the seminal work of Herodotus as his starting point, Lacey reconstructs the tactical and strategic scenario of the battle, including how many combatants each side might have used and who actually led the Greeks. He also disputes the long-repeated myths of Athenian inexperience and effete Persian arrogance.<br> <br>With the kind of vivid detail that characterizes the best modern war reportage, Lacey shows how the heavily armed Persian army was shocked, demoralized, and ultimately defeated by the relentless assault of the Athenian phalanx, which battered the Persian line in a series of brutal attacks. He reveals the fascinating aftermath of Marathon, how its fighters became the equivalent of our &#x201c;Greatest Generation,&#x201d; and challenges the view of many historians that Marathon ultimately proved the Greek &#x201c;Western way of war&#x201d; to be the superior strategy for fighting&#x2014;and winning&#x2014;battles to the present day. <br> <br>Immediate, visceral, and full of new analyses that defy decades of conventional wisdom, <i>The First Clash</i> is a superb interpretation of a conflict that indeed made the world safe for Aristotle, Plato, and our own modern democracy. But it was also a battle whose legacy and lessons have often been misunderstood&#x2014;perhaps, now more than ever, at our own peril.</p><p><b>Jim Lacey</b> was an active-duty military officer for twelve years in the 82nd Airborne Division and the 101st Airborne Division.

To his west, where the Greek cities of Ionia dotted the Aegean coastline, a long, costly war had finally ended. These often troublesome Greeks were presently awed by Lydian power and were now paying him annual tribute. To the north, from which the terrifying Scythian horsemen in previous generations had swept down in devastating raids, it had been quiet since his father, Alyattes II, broke the back of Cimmerian power decades before.1 To the south, Babylonia remained a strong and dependable ally, a state of affairs that was unlikely to change as long as mighty Babylon felt threatened by the power of the Medes, who occupied the lands east of both Lydia and Babylon.<br><br>Since the crushing of the Cimmerians and the demise of the dreaded Assyrian Empire in 613 BC, the Medes had been Lydia&#x2019;s most serious threat. For five bloody years, during the reign of Alyattes II, Lydia fought an exhausting war to halt Median expansion. Herodotus reports that the war ended only when in the midst of a great battle both sides withdrew in terror as a solar eclipse darkened the field.2 Whatever the influence of the eclipse, the truth is that the war so exhausted both sides, they willingly allowed Babylon to arbitrate an end to the fighting.<br><br>The &#x201c;Peace of the Eclipse&#x201d; lasted a generation. In that time, Lydia, the first state to create a standardized coinage, grew rich. So rich, in fact, that even today Croesus&#x2019;s name is synonymous with vast wealth and riches. However, the Medes, while not as rich as Lydia, had also grown powerful and ever more threatening. So it was with a certain amount of contentment that Croesus had watched the Medes spend the recent years engaged in a bloody civil war with their cousins the Persians. But by 547, that war had ended and a new Persian-Median king, Cyrus, was solidifying his hold on power. For Croesus this was a troubling development, as the combined power of the Medes and Persians was a dire threat and the youthful Cyrus appeared restless. To forestall a Persian invasion of Lydia, Croesus determined to wage a preemptive war before Cyrus could complete his consolidation of power. But first he had to determine if the gods would bless his enterprise.<br><br>According to Herodotus, prior to starting his war with the Persians, Croesus sent envoys to determine the accuracy of each of the major oracles used by the Greeks to foretell the future. After putting each to the test, Croesus decided that the oracle of Delphi was the most accurate. He sent envoys bearing rich gifts to inquire as to the outcome of a war between the Lydians and the Persians. He was much cheered by the Delphic oracle&#x2019;s promise that if the Lydian army marched against the Persians, a great empire would be destroyed. Unfortunately for Croesus, it did not occur to him to ask another important question: Which great empire would be destroyed? He interpreted the oracle&#x2019;s words as it best suited his desires and forwarded immense gifts to Delphi, and to several other temples, to secure the full support of the gods.<br><br>When the threat Cyrus presented first arose, Croesus also began a period of active diplomacy in an attempt to assemble allies for the coming fight. This resulted in promises of support from Babylonia, Egypt, and even Sparta. If only he had waited for these forces to gather at his capital, the Persian state might well have died in infancy. But believing immediate action was necessary and buoyed by Delphi&#x2019;s promise of success, Croesus determined to strike out with only his own forces on hand. Beyond the promises of Delphi, Croesus&#x2019;s confidence rested on the fact that Lydia possessed what was probably the most formidable army in the Near East. It consisted of heavy armored infantry (much of it from the Greek cities along the Aegean) and a formidable host of local levies. However, the mainstay of the Lydian army was its elite heavy cavalry, universally feared for its expert use of lances from horseback.<br><br>With the gods propitiated by numerous gifts of gold, the Lydian army launched itself against King Cyrus. In 547 BC, the Lydians marched into Cappadocia, which had been under Median lordship since Assyria&#x2019;s collapse. After crossing the Halys River, which had been set as the Median-Lydian boundary by the Peace of the Eclipse, Croesus captured the supposedly strongly fortified city of Pteria and devastated the surrounding country, while waiting to see how Cyrus would react to the provocation. He did not have long to wait. Cyrus, apparently forewarned of the attack, was ready to move immediately after receiving information as to the direction of the Lydian offensive. Moving rapidly from his new capital at Ecbatana, Cyrus gathered further recruits along his line of march, and in what must have been a matter of a couple of weeks, the Persians pitched their camp within striking distance of the Lydian army. Herodotus indicates that the battle that took place was fierce and that many fell on both sides. However, when the fighting ended, at the onset of darkness, there was still no victor. Croesus, who must have been shocked by the speed and strength of Cyrus&#x2019;s response, blamed his lack of success on the Persians&#x2019; greater numbers and determined to fall back on his capital, Sardis, and await the arrival of his allies.<br><br>If his army was still in good condition and he had the city of Pteria as a base, and presumably had access to Sinope on the Black Sea, then there was no reason Croesus could not have wintered his army in Cappadocia and awaited his allies. Therefore it is likely that his army, though not vanquished, received a severe battering. Furthermore, his previous policy of ruining the surrounding country had probably left the countryside denuded of supplies. Croesus was now paying for his policy of systematic devastation, which had greatly shortened the time he could linger in Cappadocia; even under the best of circumstances, an army could remain stationary only a short time before it consumed all of the area&#x2019;s available resources. After failing to win a decisive victory against the Persians, he did not have the choice of staying. Circumstances compelled him to retreat or starve. Still worse lay ahead of him, for Croesus had neglected to stock his capital at Sardis with sufficient provisions to sustain his army through the winter. So upon his arrival at the capital, he was forced to disband all of his army, except for his elite cavalry, and ordered it to reassemble in the spring. At the same time, he sent envoys to Egypt, Babylonia, and Sparta and requested them to bring their armies to Sardis in three months, whereupon their combined might would see Cyrus off.<br><br>Cyrus was now left in an unenviable position. The same reason that had compelled Croesus to abandon Cappadocia was now acting on him: A devastated country would not supply his army through the winter. In such circumstances, all precedent called for Cyrus to fall back to Ecbatana, where he could refurbish his army for the next season&#x2019;s campaign. Realizing that his enemies would gather in vast numbers against him in the spring, Cyrus knew that the prudent course only delayed his doom. Therefore he launched his army into an unheard-of winner-take-all winter campaign and followed Croesus&#x2019;s retreating army into Lydia.<br><br>Surprised at his foe&#x2019;s audacity, Croesus weighed his options. Most of his army had left for their homes, and it would be months before any of his allies would appear to assist him. Still, the walls of Sardis were considered impregnable, and most leaders would have considered holing up inside of them until the winter frost decimated the Persian army or until his allies would eventually come to the rescue. Instead, Croesus opted to give battle with the much-reduced forces available to him. Historians have often commented on the folly of his choice, but under the circumstances it was probably the best available. While it is true the Sardis region had not been devastated like Cappadocia, it still could not have had much food left on hand. It had been the mustering point for the Lydian invasion, and as such the Lydian army would have consumed much of the reserve food stores before marching into Cappadocia. Furthermore, the army would have packed much of what was left on wagons and mules to supplement whatever it collected on the march. By early winter, the reserve food stores must have been very low, if they existed at all. Given these circumstances, the idea of a siege of many months must have filled Croesus&#x2019;s head with visions of famine. As Croesus had not taken the precaution of restocking his magazines within the city, what food stores did exist were probably still stored in the countryside, left for Cyrus to use. As long as Cyrus was not averse to seeing the rural population starve (and it is a safe guess that he would find this acceptable), then his food situation was probably markedly better than what Croesus faced in the city, where he had to feed both his own population and his army. Moreover, as is frequently the case, military commanders tend to magnify their own difficulties while discounting those faced by their opponents. In the final analysis, Croesus probably saw no option except to risk all on a final decisive battle. If he lost, he could still in the last resort retreat behind the protection of Sardis&#x2019;s walls.<br><br>Despite dismissing the bulk of his army, Croesus still possessed the Lydian cavalry, a formidable force, while the plains in front of Sardis afforded perfect terrain for their operations. For Cyrus&#x2019;s part, he had to consider carefully how to engage such a dangerous foe. Taking the advice of Harpagos, his most trusted general, Cyrus had the baggage camels unloaded and placed at the front of his lines to act as cavalry. As the Lydians did not use camels in their operations, Cyrus hoped that the sight and foul odors of these strange beasts would panic the Lydian horses.<br><br>This is precisely what happened.

It was wider than his old one; it was taller, too. It made everything else in his kitchen look small and a trifle dirty. Brand new, he decided, and styled in a subtly pleasing way nothing in the store was. No doubt he had special-ordered. No doubt it had been delivered, and he had opened the door for the delivery and exchanged a few tired jokes with the men who brought it. When they had gone, he had no doubt wiped it down and waxed it with appliance wax.</p> <p>Roy Tabak sold refrigerators, and he could remember none of that.</p> <p>He opened the main compartment. There was food in it, and it looked good. There was beer in it, too, twenty bottles as least. It was not his brand, and the food was not his. What was that green stuff?</p> <p>Movers, clearly, had been moving furniture and so forth into a new apartment. There had not been room enough in the van for this large refrigerator, so they had made a separate trip for it. They had put it in his apartment by mistake. No doubt they had been amateurs, friends helping some friend move. They had failed to notice that the refrigerator had been full of food and beer.</p> <p>It was all very simple and convincing, and it would be more simple and convincing after a beer. Still more after six or eight. Aloud, Roy Tabak said, &#x201c;Hell and damn!&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;If you are unable to find that which you seek,&#x201d; his new refrigerator said politely, &#x201c;I may be able to direct you, sir.&#x201d;</p> <p>Roy Tabak went into the living room and sat down. How many beers had he had? None at all. He had just gotten home from work. Besides, beer didn&#x2019;t do that. He took off his suit coat and hung it almost neatly in the hall closet, loosened his tie, then removed it altogether and draped it over the back of a chair. His collar was not tight, but he unbuttoned it anyway. Tight collars could make you hear voices, right?</p> <p>After much searching, enlivened by some pacing up and down, during which he was careful not to look through his cramped little dining room into his kitchen, the phone book provided the number of the Free Psychiatric Hotline&#x2014;&#x201c;Trained Psycholagists on Duty 24/7.&#x201d; The misspelling of &#x201c;psychologists&#x201d; did nothing to increase his confidence, but he dialed the number anyway.</p> <p>&#x201c;Free Psychiatric Hotline. How can we help you?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not normal to hear voices, is it?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That depends. You&#x2019;re hearing mine right now, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mean like that,&#x201d; Roy said. &#x201c;You know what I mean.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Voices that accuse you of things?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Voices that urge you to commit murder?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Huh-uh. This voice offered to help me find something in my&#x2014;I mean in the refrigerator in my kitchen.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Ummm.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It was very polite. Like a woman&#x2019;s voice, but like the noise a refrigerator makes when it runs. You know.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I wish I did. Is there a woman there with you?&#x201d;</p> <p>Roy Tabak winced. &#x201c;No. No, there&#x2019;s not.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Maybe a neighbor?&#x201d;</p> <p>Mrs. Jackson was not at all bad looking; there had been times when he had envied Mr. Jackson. Mrs. Adcock was a bit too old. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m alone.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Perhaps someone just dropped in. Someone selling something.&#x201d;</p> <p>Dahlia&#x2014;over in Lingerie&#x2014;was hotter than hell. Roy said, &#x201c;I sell things myself. Stoves, refrigerators, trash compactors, microwaves. Stuff like that. I&#x2019;m the only one in here who sells things.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What do the others do?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;There aren&#x2019;t any others.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I see. How often have you heard the voices?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Just one voice, and I&#x2019;ve only heard it once.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Okay.&#x2026; It was probably somebody outside, or else a radio or something. If you hear these voices again, call back.&#x201d;</p> <p>Feeling defeated, Roy said, &#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Especially if they want you to kill people. Or kill yourself. I&#x2019;ve been looking through the index, but there&#x2019;s nothing about finding stuff in the refrigerator, see? So what I need is something that&#x2019;s here in DUFFY AND STANKY.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Uh-huh.&#x201d; Roy Tabak hung up. It had been a dream. Almost certainly it had been a dream that he had somehow taken for reality. He would call out to the refrigerator, and it would not reply.</p> <p>A little later, when he felt more secure.</p> <p>What had happened to his tie? He switched on the TV, winced, and muted the sound. Baseball was never on when he wanted to watch it. Somebody must be in charge of that.</p> <p>&#x201c;We single men,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;we like to go out at night. We cruise the bars, and now and then we hook up. You start the game around seven-thirty, and we don&#x2019;t watch because we know we won&#x2019;t get to see anything past the fourth inning.&#x201d;</p> <p>The TV remained muted. It would be nice, Roy Tabak reflected, if they would build TVs that listened to you.</p> <p>He returned to the kitchen, half expecting that his old refrigerator would be there. The new refrigerator still gleamed. It had no eyes, no nose, and no mouth, yet it somehow looked quiet. And helpful. It was eager to help. You could see that.</p> <p>Both his kitchen chairs were narrow, shiny, and much less than comfortable. He pulled one out just the same and sat down on it to study the refrigerator.</p> <p>The refrigerator studied him back. After five minutes or so, he got it. The freezer door was opaque from outside but transparent from inside, sort of like the security mirrors in the store. The refrigerator&#x2019;s eyes were behind it. Watching.</p> <p>He got up, opened the food storage door, and got a beer. It was a SUPER-URB lager, brewed in Al Fashir, New Jersey. He opened it, said, &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s to you,&#x201d; and drank. It was better than his brand.</p> <p>There were corn chips in the bread box. He opened the bag. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t suppose you have any chip dip?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I have three,&#x201d; his new refrigerator said politely. &#x201c;Guavacado, whipped kasseri, and fava-bean habas. Which would you prefer?&#x201d;</p> <p>Roy Tabak sipped his beer, rose, opened his new refrigerator, and took out the green stuff.</p> <p>&#x201c;Ah! The guavacado. Good choice, sir.&#x201d;</p> <p>It was in an oddly shaped container so transparent as to be almost invisible. The green paste it held tasted just fine on a corn chip.</p> <p>&#x201c;I have a talking refrigerator,&#x201d; Roy Tabak said. He gulped beer. &#x201c;Do you know what that proves? It proves that the world is one hell of a lot more complicated than I thought.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Indeed, sir.&#x201d;</p> <p>Roy scooped up more guavacado dip. &#x201c;Are you a Kelvinator?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No, sir.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Mmmm.&#x201d; He munched a chip. &#x201c;Whirlpool?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No, sir.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;KitchenAid?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No, sir. I am your refrigerator, sir. It might be best to leave it at that.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I am here to help you.&#x201d; Roy Tabak&#x2019;s new refrigerator sounded soothing, almost motherly.</p> <p>He sipped more beer and swallowed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re from the government, right?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No, sir.

I say we because I am a possession of the Society. Need I explain further?&#x201d;</p> <p>Chewing, Roy Tabak nodded.</p> <p>&#x201c;Very well. You are familiar with dogs, I hope.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t own one,&#x201d; Roy Tabak told his refrigerator, &#x201c;but my folks adopted a greyhound named Chester when I was a kid. They said he was too old to race, but he was faster than a million-dollar microwave.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Clearly you observed him, sir. Because you did, you must have observed that this Chester employed the pronoun to which you objected when referring to your family and himself. He might have said we are going to the beach, for example.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t take dogs to the beach,&#x201d; Roy Tabak told his new refrigerator. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re not allowed.&#x201d;</p> <p>The telephone rang.</p> <p>&#x201c;Excuse me.&#x201d; He rose and went into his living room. &#x201c;Hello.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Roy, you dog! Who&#x2019;s the fat broad?&#x201d; It was Jerry Pitt from Gourmet Foods.</p> <p>Roy Tabak tried to remember. That girl he had talked to in the Home Office, had she been fat? Not very, but his Aunt Irene&#x2019;s daughters were all fat. &#x201c;Probably a cousin,&#x201d; he said.</p> <p>&#x201c;Sure. Just staying with you until she can get a job. I&#x2019;ve got it.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Wait a minute.&#x201d; Roy Tabak thought frantically. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got this new service, see. A&#x2014;whatchacallum. An answering service. It&#x2019;s better than an answering machine because mine keeps breaking. You phoned, right? And this girl answered. You probably tried to date her.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Roy, Roy, Roy! Come off it. Let&#x2019;s get real.&#x201d;</p> <p>Yeah, Roy Tabak thought, wouldn&#x2019;t I love to!</p> <p>&#x201c;I came over to your building, see?&#x201d; Jerry sounded impatient. &#x201c;And I rang the bell downstairs and somebody buzzed me in. So I went up to your place. Do I have to keep telling you?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Go ahead,&#x201d; Roy Tabak said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m listening.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I knocked and she answered the door. You probably told her not to, but she did it anyway. I said, &#x2018;Where&#x2019;s Roy?&#x2019; And she said you hadn&#x2019;t come home yet and did I want to come in and wait for you? She said she&#x2019;d get me a beer or some ice cream. I said, &#x2018;No thanks and have a nice day,&#x2019; and I beat it.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Listen, Jerry, this is serious.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s married, huh?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;There was really a woman in my apartment? You&#x2019;re not shitting me?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Hell, no. You mean you don&#x2019;t know about her? She was a burglar or something?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No, but it&#x2019;s complicated. What did she look like?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Well &#x2026; fat, like I said. Big and really heavy. She wouldn&#x2019;t be bad looking if she lost a hundred and fifty pounds. Hell, she&#x2019;s not all that bad now. Blond, blue eyes, sort of a square face, only fat cheeks, you know?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah, I know. What else?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;A white dress and a white apron. Sort of a gag necklace. One of those novelty necklaces. Little bottles, all different colors, strung together. Beer and Pepsi. I remember those.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter,&#x201d; Roy Tabak said.</p> <p>&#x201c;One was champagne&#x2014;that was the big bottle in the middle. There was a red bottle, too. I think it must&#x2019;ve been Tabasco sauce.&#x201d;</p> <p>Roy felt impatient, but tried not to sound like it. &#x201c;How old would you say she was?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Twenty-five, maybe. She could have been younger, though. Great big chicks look older, you know?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Sure. Go on.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No rings. I looked for them, you know how you do.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Only she wanted you to come in for a beer, and you wouldn&#x2019;t do it.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I got Deedee, you know? Besides, I&#x2019;d never do a thing like that to you.&#x201d;</p> <p>Roy Tabak took a deep breath. &#x201c;You said, &#x2018;Hi, I&#x2019;m Jerry Pitt and I&#x2019;m a friend of Roy&#x2019;s.&#x2019; Something like that?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah. Sure.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But she didn&#x2019;t tell you her name?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Nope.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;She told you something. What was it?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Nothing. She didn&#x2019;t tell me anything.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Jerry, listen to me and listen real good. Are you listening, dumbfuck?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Hey, you don&#x2019;t have to get rough.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather not, Jerry. But I work in Appliances and you work in Gourmet Foods. I&#x2019;m lifting heavy stuff all day while you&#x2019;re pushing cookies. What was her name?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you, Roy. Honest.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d better. What was it?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;She never said her name, only she was wearing one of those little name pins like waitresses have on sometimes.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Keep talking, Jerry.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Well, I read what was on it. It said Frostfree. All one word. I used to know a guy named Frost once. Was it Ed? Wait a minute&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t matter. Listen, I&#x2019;ll call you back.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Earl! That was it. Earl Frost.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call you back,&#x201d; Roy repeated, and hung up.</p> <p>Returning to the kitchen, he straddled a chrome-and-plastic chair and sat, resting his arms on the back. &#x201c;Do you still talk?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; replied his new refrigerator.</p> <p>&#x201c;Good.&#x201d; Thoughtfully, Roy Tabak loaded a last corn chip. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got a little plate on your freezer door. It says &#x2018;Frostfree.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, sir. It indicates, correctly, that I need never be defrosted&#x2014;this even though my freezer remains frigid at all times.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I know what it means. Jerry Pitt came over and rang the bell. You buzzed him in.&#x201d; Roy tapped a cigarette from the pack in his shirt pocket, lit it, and inhaled. His new refrigerator remained silent. At last he said, &#x201c;Why did you do that?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I hoped your caller might be a young woman, sir.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Did you now?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, sir. I did.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You wanted some female company?&#x201d; Roy blew smoke through his nose.</p> <p>&#x201c;For you, sir. It is my mission.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You want to fix me up.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, sir. Precisely.&#x201d;</p> <p>More smoke. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a whole lot to take on, for a refrigerator.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m acutely conscious of it, sir. May I explain? The WSPC has taken an interest in your case.&#x201d;</p> <p>Roy ground out his cigarette in the ashtray on the kitchen table. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a case.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, sir. That&#x2019;s it exactly.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;A mental case.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, no, sir!&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get back to Jerry. When he came to the door, a girl opened it. That girl was wearing the little plate from your door. She was wearing it, or one just like it. Was she from that outfit you mentioned?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;The WSPC, sir? Yes, sir, she was&#x2014;that is to say, I am. I belong to the foundation, sir. It is my owner.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That was you? You were the one who answered the door?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, sir. Would you like another beer, sir?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; Roy Tabak opened his new refrigerator and took out a longneck; its label read SUPER-URB. &#x201c;If I drink enough of these, you may start to make sense.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a very sensible machine, sir, well designed, solidly built, and useful. I will provide many years of service.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What about when you&#x2019;re a girl? Are you still a sensible girl then?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, sir. I am sensible in both forms.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You can change shape?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Transform, sir. Yes, sir, I can and do. May I explain?&#x201d;</p> <p>Roy Tabak nodded.</p> <p>&#x201c;I began, sir, as an effort of the appliance industry. You are familiar with the appliance industry.&#x201d;</p> <p>Roy nodded again. &#x201c;Very.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It was desired, sir, to create a single appliance which would serve as both a refrigerator and a dishwasher.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s crazy!&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No, sir. Only difficult. It was soon realized that my dishwashing mechanism could not be interior, sir. My interior must be kept cold at all times in order to preserve the just-harvested freshness of vegetables, for example.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I say that. I say &#x2018;just-harvested freshness&#x2019; when I&#x2019;m talking to customers. You&#x2019;ve been listening to me.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Only a very little bit, sir. Hardly at all.&#x201d; Roy&#x2019;s new refrigerator spoke rapidly, apparently to prevent his protesting the change of subject. &#x201c;Since the dishwashing function could not be internal, it would have to be external. Utilizing the transformer principle made external dishwashing possible and, indeed, successful. It was then suggested that we might serve as programmable stoves as well. That was found to be impractical, since an oven would have to be internal. However&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Wait up!&#x201d; Roy Tabak sat straight. &#x201c;You said you were a dishwasher, right? You&#x2019;re a dishwasher, too?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I am, sir. It is my glory.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Well, my sink&#x2019;s full of dirty dishes. Let&#x2019;s see you wash them.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Although I hesitate to correct you, sir, your sink is no longer filled with dirty dishes. I washed them in your absence, sir.&#x201d;</p> <p>Roy rose and looked into his sink. It was empty and spotless.</p> <p>&#x201c;Your dishes are in that cabinet, sir. There was an abundance of shelf space, and I felt&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; Roy opened a cabinet door. &#x201c;You reached up there and put them in?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I did, sir. It was the only way&#x2014;or so it appeared to me. May I continue, sir?&#x201d;</p> <p>He nodded.</p> <p>&#x201c;The oven requirement decided the matter. We could not function as programmable stoves. We could, however, apply our programmability to stove functions, by this means rendering a pr...</p></p><h2>Jacob Lawrence: American Scenes, American Struggles</h2><p>Take a closer look at the American scene through the eyes of an extremely talented artist. Page after page of beautiful, original artwork fills the mind with portraits, trials, and tribulations of American life from the early 1900s to the present day. Visualize the struggles of African-Americans--and of the United States as a whole--from the days of slavery to celebrations of today. Included are different types of activities for exploring paintings that will spark creativity and imagination. 48 pages, 100 color illus., 31 b/w illus., 8 1/2 x 10. <br></p><p>Howard's tribute to Jacob Lawrence (see Toussaint L'Ouverture, reviewed above) takes on the artist's personal history, the intricacies of his "collage cubist" style, the lives of four black heroes and the reader's own creative imagination-all at once. As the stories of Toussaint L'Ouverture, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman and John Brown-as well as the artist's own life-unfold in excerpts from Lawrence's series of paintings, exercises help the reader understand the artist's use of symbolism, composition and abstraction. Simple activities urge readers to experience the paintings through movement ("You can see how the artist creates a dramatic mood by posing your body in the same positions as Harriet [Tubman]'s body") or through the creation of their own images and stories. Driven by the multiple imperatives of history, art history and biography, the busy layout eventually becomes visually exhausting. The final, unillustrated biographical note fills in material that is elsewhere covered in fragments. While the mishmash of text, captions, biographical quotes and exercises is intended to help readers see the art, the eclectic format leaves little opportunity for quiet contemplation. Ages 8-up. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.Most of Lawrence's works that are covered in this book- -subtitled ``American Scenes, American Struggles''--such as The Great Migration, or the lives of Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, and Toussaint L'Ouverture, involve a series of paintings that chronicle African-American history or create a biographical portrait. The approach in this Closer Look Activity Book, which sends readers through the pages for answers to multiple questions, is a little overbearing in paintings that eloquently speak for themselves. Howard offers several paths: Text printed in italics represents direct quotes; red, yellow, and green squares and progressively shrinking typeface indicate projects related to the art. Captions and cartoon bubbles further animate the paintings. The reproductions of Lawrence's work are quite good, and many of the questions help readers identify his use of symbols, understand the stories his painting tell, and learn about his life. Unlike The Great Migration (1993), which reads like a quiet walk through a gallery accompanied by the artist, Howard's book is more like a scavenger hunt through the art itself.

Vallee</p><p>Introduction by Burt Rutan</p><p>Commentary by Tom Clancy</p><p><i>A never-before-heard firsthand account of a government insider's experience on the cutting edge of UFO exploration </i><br><i></i><br><i></i><br>While still on active duty in the U.S. Army during the 1980s, Colonel John B. Alexander, Ph.D., created an interagency group to explore the controversial topic of UFOs. Participants came from the Army, Navy, Air Force, CIA, NSA, DIA, and the aerospace industry. All members held Top Secret clearance. What they discovered was not at all what was expected. <i>UFOs </i>covers the numerous cases they saw, and answers questions like: </p><p>� What was really in Hanger 18? </p><p>� Did a UFO land at Holloman Air Force Base? </p><p>� What happened at Roswell? </p><p>� What is Majestic 12? </p><p>� What is the Aviary? </p><p>� What does the government know about UFOs? </p><p>� What has happened with disclosure in other countries? </p><p>� Has the U.S. reverse engineered a UFO? </p><p>� Why don't presidents get access to UFO info? </p><p><i>UFOs </i>is at once a complete account of Alexander's findings, and a call to action. There are no conspiracy theories here--only hard facts--but they are merely the beginning. Serious research is needed in order to understand and anticipate the workings of UFOs, and John Alexander is leading the charge.</p></p><p><p>Dr. John B. Alexander, a Green Beret combat veteran, was a colonel when he retired from the U.S. Army; a project manager at Los Alamos National Laboratory; a member of NATO, National Research Council, and Council on Foreign Relations, studies of non-lethal weapons; a consultant to the National Intelligence Council, CIA, US Special Operations Command, and the Army Science Board. He is widely published in several areas. Currently he is a senior fellow at a DoD university and lives with his wife, Victoria, in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p><b>1</b><br>&nbsp;<br>ADVANCED THEORETICAL PHYSICS PROJECT DISCLOSED<br><br><i>Do or do not&nbsp;... there is no try.</i><br>&#x2014;MASTER YODA, <i>THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK</i><br><br><i>&#x201c;There is a black UFO program someplace. Let&#x2019;s see if we can find it. If the rumors are right, THEY have a tiger by the tail and want help transitioning the information to the public. Somebody has got to be minding the store&#x2014;who is it?&#x201d;</i><br>It was with that premise that the <i>Advanced Theoretical Physics Project</i> (ATP) was born. I&#x2019;d like to say it was in the bowels of the Pentagon; it has such a nice ring to it, but that would not be true. Rather, it was located in my unbelievably spacious office in Tysons Corner, Virginia, with views of the Shenandoah Mountains to the west.<br>With help from a few other researchers we initiated the ATP project specifically to examine issues regarding UFOs, and what role the Department of Defense (DoD) might be playing. Like most of the general public, we assumed somebody in DoD had responsibility for studying UFOs. This was a small internal group drawn from the government and aerospace industry, all of whom were interested in the topic. Admission was by invitation only, and those selected to participate had to have the right credentials. This chapter outlines what few people outside the membership of that group have ever heard about. In fact, very few of them know the full story. What we expected was not what we found.<br>Years later, sitting in front of Lieutenant General Jim Abrahamson, then the director of the highly acclaimed Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), known more popularly as Star Wars, I began the briefing to him and explained that we were there to discuss UFOs. It took only a few minutes before he stopped me and asked, &#x201c;Who are you guys really?&#x201d; That spoke volumes about the subject and where UFOs were on the SDI priority list. This is the story of how we got there, and beyond.<br>To appreciate the importance of the research presented, background material is provided to allow better understanding of the depth of penetration that was accomplished. Of significance are the personal relationships that intertwine over time; always assisting when needed. Note that the interactions with most agencies were not simple onetime interviews, but ones that gave continuing support at various levels. Also of importance was the manner in which traditional military research and development functions were juxtaposed with UFO interests. Understanding how that unique fusion occurred is critical to knowing how this effort was accomplished. It was that aspect that separates this research from all others in the field.<br><b>Setting the Stage</b><br>The creation and execution of the Advanced Theoretical Physics group did not just happen. Rather, it took considerable coordination and effort. Often the direction I was moving in my career was not clear to me at the onset. In fact, at my retirement from the Army, I told the assembled group that it was as if some external force seemed to guide my actions. When I resisted various movements and failed to get my way; it was only later that the necessity for certain events to have occurred become apparent. Maybe it was synchronicity, but the eventual functions and outcomes that led to the observations in this book were far too complex to have been planned or orchestrated by me. While the emphasis here is on UFO studies, there were interactions in many other realms of phenomena that remain totally intertwined with destiny.<br>To understand the significance of this research effort, some fairly extensive background knowledge is required. In that way the reader will be able to discern how all of the pieces fit together. The ATP project was actually the result of substantial groundwork in establishing various credentials in the military that allowed me to function within acceptable limits while simultaneously pushing the boundaries of traditional credibility. It also required finding the right network of people who would be willing to participate in projects that could be perilous to one&#x2019;s career, and establishing the set of senior officials who could fly cover for such an operation. In general, the military is fairly risk-aversive. To get promoted in the military the conventional wisdom was to assume assignments where the potential for failure was minimal. Venturing into studies of psi phenomena and UFOs was not seen as career enhancing. As a mustang (former enlisted noncommissioned officer who went to Officer Candidate School), and who had chosen Special Forces missions over straight infantry assignments, I knew my time was limited and further promotion beyond lieutenant colonel was out of the question&#x2014;but that was wrong.<br><b>Enter the Voodoo Warriors</b><br>In the summer of 1980, recently promoted and fresh out of Command and General Staff College (CGSC) at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, I was assigned to the Headquarters of the Department of the Army Inspector General&#x2019;s office (DAIG). There we conducted inspections on systemic issues as selected by the Inspector General of the Army, Lieutenant General Richard Trefry.<br>While attending CGSC I had written and submitted a manuscript to <i>Military Review,</i> the staid journal of the college. The piece was called <i>&#x201c;The New Mental Battlefield.&#x201d;</i> This article described the potential use of remote viewing, psychokinesis, and similar psychic skills in military operations. In fact, this was the first time that these subjects had ever been broached in an official U.S. Army publication. The article was published in December 1980 and, strangely, became the cover story for that issue. In one of many synchronistic incidents, the editor of the magazine had previously had a near-death experience in which he found himself out of his body. He was therefore fascinated with the article, and the cover came complete with pictures of Kirlian photography. While they were not really germane to the story, this was quite a departure for a traditional professional military journal. The immediate impact was relatively muted within the Army and I continued with regular IG work. However, Ron McCrae, one of the staff writers for the noted Washington columnist Jack Anderson, spotted the article. McCrae drafted an editorial for Anderson which was then published in <i>The Washington Post</i> under the title <i>&#x201c;The Voodoo Warriors of the Pentagon.&#x201d;</i><br>Obviously Jack Anderson&#x2019;s article, which was picked up by the wire services, was not very supportive of the notion of military applications of psychic capabilities. Anderson was known for finding topics that would incense the public, and often dealt with government waste of taxpayer money. Certainly, the writers assumed, the concept of government funding psychic warfare would get a response from the public. Anderson and McCrae were right, but not as they had anticipated. Rather than being angry about sinking money into a possible psychic warfare program, the public wrote in to tell Anderson how much they appreciated knowing that this research was going on. Given the 1970 publication of Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schroeder&#x2019;s popular book, <i>Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain</i>, many civilians believed that the Soviets were seriously pursuing these topics and that the United States had fallen behind.<br>It was from Anderson&#x2019;s article that I experienced blowback as well. One morning, while sitting at my desk in C-Ring on the first floor of the Pentagon, a red-faced lieutenant colonel accosted me. He was assigned to the Office of the Army&#x2019;s Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Major General Ed Thompson, and they were furious about the Anderson expos�. He first asked if I had written the article, and then he wanted to know if I was aware of the clearance procedures for publications of any nature. Fortuitously, I happened to have the file with me that contained all of the administrative paperwork associated with the <i>Military Review</i> article. Once shown that his office had signed off approving the publication of the manuscript, he left in a huff. Of course what had upset them so much was that they had responsibility for the secret embryonic remote viewing program, then-called <i>Grill Flame</i>. After many years in the black world, this program was declassified in 1995, and became known to the public by its final designation, <i>Star Gate</i>.<br><b>Task Force Delta&#x2014;Defining the Difference that Makes a Difference</b><br>Although officially working for the Inspector General of the Army I was already participating in a very unique organization called Task Force Delta. This is not to be confused with the more famous Delta Force, � la Colonel Charlie Beckwith, with a counterterrorist mission. (As a side note, &#x201c;Charging&#x201d; Charlie Beckwith and I were students in the same Ranger class [2-58] in the late summer and fall of 1958. He was a decidedly boisterous lieutenant, and I was a very junior enlisted soldier who was promoted to sergeant by graduating from that grueling course.)<br>In fact, this new Task Force Delta was an Army version of a think tank and was facilitated by some very enlightened senior leadership. That top echelon comprised three- and four-star generals who knew the Army needed dramatic revamping given the vicissitudes that followed Vietnam. There was a need, they thought, to have people available to address tough, multifarious problems in an unconstrained environment. Blue sky thinking was not only allowed, it was encouraged.<br>It was there that Lieutenant Colonel Jim Channon brought out his <i>First Earth Battalion,</i> a notional unit with concepts easily three decades ahead of their time.

On the surface: the very model of Victorian modesty, reserve, and duty, the devoted husband and father. In actuality: a man whose emotional and working energies were in large part expended on the care and cultivation of the flamboyant, mesmerizing genius of the stage, Henry Irving.<br><br>We see Stoker the writer of novels and stories that were imbued with sexuality, violence, and the celebration of death -- works at opposite poles from the decorum he presented in society. And Barbara Belford shows us in Dracula a mirror of the undercurrents of Stoker's own life, as well as a masked exploration of subjects utterly forbidden in his time -- seduction, rape, necrophilia, incest, voyeurism -- universal taboos dramatized with such a myth-making edge that the novel remains resonant and unsettling almost one hundred years later.<br><br>We follow Stoker from his sickly childhood -entertained by his mother's twice-told tales of Irish hobgoblins and banshees -- to his years as a Dublin undergraduate and newspaperman, when he first wrote to his idol Wait Whitman, spilling out his innermost thoughts and beginning a lifelong correspondence that culminated in their meeting when Stoker traveled to America on tour with Irving and Ellen Terry. We see Stoker's childhood friendship with Oscar Wilde, and watch as the two young men compete for the hand of the beautiful Florence Balcombe, who became Stoker's wife. And we see Stoker in the literary and theatrical circles of Victorian London among such figures as Mark Twain, Arthur Conan Doyle, James Whistler, Lord Tennyson, and George Bernard Shaw.<br><br>Belford gives us a vivid picture of the man, his time, his London -- the domestic and theatrical worlds he lived in -- and the dark imaginary realms that were the wellspring of all his writings, especially of his enduring and enduringly fascinating Dracula.</p><p>"I am here to do Your bidding, Master. I am Your slave, and You will reward me, for I shall be faithful." These words spoken by Renfield to Dracula might have been said by Bram Stoker to his boss, the mesmerizing, domineering actor Henry Irving. Stoker was such a mild-mannered, secretive man that the real subject of this acclaimed biography turns out to be the genesis of his novel <i>Dracula</i>, and Irving--the man who, according to Barbara Belford, inspired its famous monster. Other fascinating characters who appear in Stoker's life are Florence Stoker (courted by Oscar Wilde before Bram married her), Ellen Terry (Irving's leading lady), Walt Whitman, the aging Lord Tennyson, W. S. Gilbert, William Gladstone, Lady Speranza Wilde, her son Oscar, Queen Victoria (who knights Irving, the first actor so honored), George Bernard Shaw, and Mark Twain. As Margot Peters writes in the <i>New York Times Book Review,</i> "Stoker himself is pretty much swamped in these heavy seas. But as Ms. Belford's intelligent, well-written and always interesting book makes clear, Stoker lived to serve. His revenge for lifelong self-effacement was <i>Dracula.</i>""Barbara Belford's historically meticulous, psychologically shrewd life of Bram Stoker goes beyond biography. Her rich and detailed picture of the world of the late Victorian theatre has a purpose: to explain the tenacious power of the sexually charged myth of Dracula."<p>-- Brenda Maddox, author of The Married Man: The Life of D. H. Lawrence</p><p>"Bram Stoker will be remembered for his devotedly long service to the great actor Sir Henry Irving, excellently commemorated in this fascinating account of their work together."</p><p>-- Sir John Gielgud</p><p>"The Lyceum chapters are wonderfully alive: Barbara Belford captures what I am sure are the tone and atmosphere of Irving's theatre, and clarified many things I had never understood about that opaque character Bram Stoker."</p><p>-- Nina Auerbach</p></p><h2>Content Mastery Series - Review Module - Fundamentals of Nursing, Edition 9.0-2016</h2><p>Fundamentals of Nursing</p><p></p><h2>Horizons Kindergarten Phonics &amp; Reading Student Book 4 (Lifepac)</h2><p>Horizons Kindergarten Phonics and Reading is a phonetically based word recognition and early reading program curriculum that serves as an alternative to the Lifepac curriculum.

Such vessels are called crucibles and they are generally made of clay or a mixture of clay and a binder such as ground up fire brick (grog) or graphite. Since they are made of clay, the process of making crucibles falls under the heading of pottery work and the technique is simple. You mix up a batch of clay, you ram the clay in a mold to form the crucible, you fire the formed crucible to harden the clay and you&#39;re ready to melt metal. It really is that simple, and this book shows you how to do it. You&#39;ll begin by learning how crucibles were made 100 years ago. Then you will take what you learn and convert it into practical information you can use today. Such topics as crucible composition and how to mix up a batch of clay. How to build molds and use them to form crucibles from your clay mix. You&#39;ll learn how to cure and fire your new crucibles, how to make crucible tongs and more.

Thompson, to name just a few. <p>Here, for the first time, an anthology which celebrates the literary heritage of Key West: the island seen through the eyes of twenty-five of its most renowned writers.</p></p><p>George Murphy for many years edited Tendril, a literary magazine. His other books include Rounding Ballast Key, The Poet&#39;s Choice: 100 American Poets Favorite Poems, The Editor&#39;s Choice: Best American Short Stories (Vols I-IV, Bantam), and (with Paul Mariani) Poetics: Essays on the Art of Poetry.

But as Ann Coulter reveals in this, her most explosive book yet, to focus solely on the Left's attacks on our Judeo-Christian tradition is to miss a larger point: liberalism <i>is</i> a religion&#x2014;a godless one.<br><br>And it is now entrenched as the state religion of this county.<br><br>Though liberalism rejects the idea of God and reviles people of faith, it bears all the attributes of a religion. In <i>Godless</i>, Coulter throws open the doors of the Church of Liberalism, showing us its sacraments (abortion), its holy writ (<i>Roe v. Wade</i>), its martyrs (from Soviet spy Alger Hiss to cop-killer Mumia Abu-Jamal), its clergy (public school teachers), its churches (government schools, where prayer is prohibited but condoms are free), its doctrine of infallibility (as manifest in the "absolute moral authority" of spokesmen from Cindy Sheehan to Max Cleland), and its cosmology (in which mankind is an inconsequential accident).<br><br>Then, of course, there's the liberal creation myth: Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.<br><br>For liberals, evolution is the touchstone that separates the enlightened from the benighted. But Coulter neatly reverses the pretense that liberals are rationalists guided by the ideals of free inquiry and the scientific method. She exposes the essential truth about Darwinian evolution that liberals refuse to confront: <i>it is bogus science</i>.<br><br>Writing with a keen appreciation for genuine science, Coulter reveals that the so-called gaps in the theory of evolution are all there is&#x2014;Darwinism is nothing but a gap. After 150 years of dedicated searching into the fossil record, evolution's proponents have failed utterly to substantiate its claims. And a long line of supposed evidence, from the infamous Piltdown Man to the "evolving" peppered moths of England, has been exposed as hoaxes. Still, liberals treat those who question evolution as religious heretics and prohibit students from hearing about real science when it contradicts Darwinism. And these are the people who say they want to keep faith out of the classroom?<br><br>Liberals' absolute devotion to Darwinism, Coulter shows, has nothing to do with evolution's scientific validity and everything to do with its refusal to admit the possibility of God as a guiding force. They will brook no challenges to the official religion.<br><br>Fearlessly confronting the high priests of the Church of Liberalism and ringing with Coulter's razor-sharp wit, <i>Godless</i> is the most important and riveting book yet from one of today's most lively and impassioned conservative voices.<br>"Liberals love to boast that they are not 'religious,' which is what one would expect to hear from the state-sanctioned religion. Of course liberalism is a religion. It has its own cosmology, its own miracles, its own beliefs in the supernatural, its own churches, its own high priests, its own saints, its own total worldview, and its own explanation of the existence of the universe. In other words, liberalism contains all the attributes of what is generally known as 'religion.'" <b>&#x2014;From Godless</b></p><p>Ann Coulter is the author of five <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, including <i>How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must)</i>, <i>Treason, Slander, and High Crimes</i> and <i>Misdemeanors</i>.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>Chapter 1: On the Seventh Day, God Rested and Liberals Schemed<br><br>Liberals love to boast that they are not &#x201c;religious,&#x201d; which is what one would expect to hear from the state-sanctioned religion. Of course liberalism is a religion. It has its own cosmology, its own miracles, its own beliefs in the supernatural, its own churches, its own high priests, its own saints, its own total worldview, and its own explanation of the existence of the universe. In other words, liberalism contains all the attributes of what is generally known as &#x201c;religion.&#x201d; <br><br>Under the guise of not favoring religion, liberals favor one cosmology over another and demand total indoctrination into theirs. The state religion of liberalism demands obeisance (to the National Organization for Women), tithing (to teachers&#x2019; unions), reverence (for abortion), and formulaic imprecations (&#x201c;Bush lied, kids died!&#x201d; &#x201c;Keep your laws off my body!&#x201d; &#x201c;Arms for hostages!&#x201d;). Everyone is taxed to support indoctrination into the state religion through the public schools, where innocent children are taught a specific belief system, rather than, say, math. <br><br>Liberal doctrines are less scientifically provable than the story of Noah&#x2019;s ark, but their belief system is taught as fact in government schools, while the Biblical belief system is banned from government schools by law. As a matter of faith, liberals believe: Darwinism is a fact, people are born gay, child-molesters can be rehabilitated, recycling is a virtue, and chastity is not. If people are born gay, why hasn&#x2019;t Darwinism weeded out people who don&#x2019;t reproduce? (For that, we need a theory of survival of the most fabulous.) And if gays can&#x2019;t change, why do liberals think child-molesters can? Pedophilia is a sexual preference. If they&#x2019;re born that way, instead of rehabilitation, how about keeping them locked up? Why must children be taught that recycling is the only answer? Why aren&#x2019;t we teaching children &#x201c;safe littering&#x201d;? <br><br>We aren&#x2019;t allowed to ask. Believers in the liberal faith might turn violent&#x2014;much like the practitioners of Islam, the Religion of Peace, who ransacked Danish embassies worldwide because a Danish newspaper published cartoons of Mohammed. This is something else that can&#x2019;t be taught in government schools: Muslims&#x2019; predilection for violence. On the first anniversary of the 9/11 attack, the National Education Association&#x2019;s instruction materials exhorted teachers, &#x201c;Do not suggest that any group is responsible&#x201d; for the attack of 9/11. <br><br>If a Martian landed in America and set out to determine the nation&#x2019;s official state religion, he would have to conclude it is liberalism, while Christianity and Judaism are prohibited by law. And not just in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where it&#x2019;s actually on the books, but throughout the land. This is a country in which taxpayers are forced to subsidize &#x201c;artistic&#x201d; exhibits of aborted fetuses, crucifixes in urine, and gay pornography. Meanwhile, it&#x2019;s unconstitutional to display a Nativity scene at Christmas or the Ten Commandments on government property if the purpose is to promote monotheistic religion. <br><br>Nearly half the members of the Supreme Court&#x2014;the ones generally known as &#x201c;liberals&#x201d;&#x2014;are itching to ban the references to God on our coins and in the Pledge of Allegiance. They resisted in 2004 on procedural grounds only because it was an election year. The absence of a divinity makes liberals&#x2019; belief system no less religious. Liberals define religion as only those belief systems that subscribe to the notion of a divine being in order to dismiss other religions as mere religion and theirs as something greater. Shintoism and Buddhism have no Creator God either, and they are considered religions. Curiously, those are two of the most popular religions among leftists&#x2014;at least until 9/11, when Islam became all the rage. <br><br>Liberalism is a comprehensive belief system denying the Christian belief in man&#x2019;s immortal soul. Their religion holds that there is nothing sacred about human consciousness. It&#x2019;s just an accident no more significant than our possession of opposable thumbs. They deny what we know about ourselves: that we are moral beings in God&#x2019;s image. Without this fundamental understanding of man&#x2019;s place in the world, we risk being lured into misguided pursuits, including bestiality, slavery, and PETA membership. Liberals swoon in pagan admiration of Mother Earth, mystified and overawed by her power. They deny the Biblical idea of dominion and progress, the most ringing affirmation of which is the United States of America. Although they are Druids, liberals masquerade as rationalists, adopting a sneering tone of scientific sophistication, which is a little like being condescended to by a tarot card reader. <br><br>Liberals hate science and react badly to it. They will literally run from the room, lightheaded and nauseated, when told of data that might suggest that the sexes have different abilities in math and science. They repudiate science when it contradicts their pagan beliefs&#x2014;that the AIDS virus doesn&#x2019;t discriminate, that there is no such thing as IQ, that nuclear power is dangerous and scary, or that breast implants cause disease. Liberals use the word science exactly as they use the word <i>constitutional</i>. <br><br>Both words are nothing more or less than a general statement of liberal approval, having nothing to do with either science or the Constitution. (Thus, for example, the following sentence makes sense to liberals: <i>President Clinton saved the Constitution by repeatedly ejaculating on a fat Jewish girl in the Oval Office</i>.) The core of the Judeo-Christian tradition says that we are utterly and distinctly apart from other species. We have dominion over the plants and the animals on Earth. God gave it to us, it&#x2019;s ours&#x2014;as stated succinctly in the book of Genesis. Liberals would sooner trust the stewardship of the Earth to Shetland ponies and dung beetles. All their pseudoscience supports an alternative religion that says we are an insignificant part of nature. <br><br>Environmentalists want mass infanticide, zero population growth, reduced standards of living, and vegetarianism. The core of environmentalism is that they hate mankind. Everything liberals believe is in elegant opposition to basic Biblical precepts. <br><br>- Our religion says that human progress proceeds from the spark of divinity in the human soul; their religion holds that human progress is achieved through sex and death. <br><br>- We believe in invention and creation; they catalogue with stupefaction the current state of our diminishing resources and tell us to stop consuming. <br><br>- We say humans stand apart from the world and our charge is Planet Earth; they say we are part of the world, and our hubristic use of nature is sinful. <br><br>- We say humans are in God&#x2019;s image; they say we are no different morally from the apes. <br><br>- We believe in populating the Earth until there&#x2019;s standing room only and then colonizing Mars; they believe humans are in the twilight of their existence. <br><br>Our book is Genesis. Their book is Rachel Carson&#x2019;s <i>Silent Spring</i>, the original environmental hoax. Carson brainwashed an entire generation into imagining a world without birds, killed by DDT. Because of liberals&#x2019; druidical religious beliefs, they won&#x2019;t allow us to save Africans dying in droves of malaria with DDT because DDT might hurt the birds. A few years after oil drilling began in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, a saboteur set off an explosion blowing a hole in the pipeline and releasing an estimated 550,000 gallons of oil. It was one of the most devastating environmental disasters in recent history. Six weeks later, all the birds were back. Birds are like rats&#x2014;you couldn&#x2019;t get rid of them if you tried. <br><br>The various weeds and vermin liberals are always trying to save are no more distinguishable than individual styles of rap music. The massive Dickey-Lincoln Dam, a $227 million hydroelectric project proposed on upper St. John River in Maine, was halted by the discovery of the Furbish lousewort, a plant previously believed to be extinct. Liberals didn&#x2019;t even know this plant still existed, but suddenly they were seized with affection for it. They had been missing it all that time! (Granted, the rediscovery of the Furbish lousewort has improved the lives of every man, woman, and child in America in ways too numerous to count, but even so . . . ) Liberals are more upset when a tree is chopped down than when a child is aborted. Even if one rates an unborn child less than a full-blown person, doesn&#x2019;t the unborn child rate slightly higher than vegetation? Liberals are constantly warning us that man is overloading the environment to the detriment of the plants. Howard Dean left the Episcopal Church&#x2014;which is barely even a church&#x2014;because his church, in Montpelier, Vermont, would not cede land for a bike path. Environmentally friendly exercise was more important than tending to the human soul. <br><br>That&#x2019;s all you need to know about the Democrats. <br><br>Blessed be the peacemakers who create a diverse, nonsexist working environment in paperless offices. Suspiciously, the Democrats&#x2019; idea of an energy policy never involves the creation of new energy. They want solar power, wind power, barley power. How about creating a new source of energy? Nuclear reactors do that with no risk of funding Arab terrorists or&#x2014;more repellent to liberals&#x2014;Big Oil Companies. But in a spasm of left-wing insanity in the seventies, nuclear power was curtailed in this country. <br><br>Japan has nuclear power, France has nuclear power&#x2014;almost all modern countries have nuclear power. But we had Jane Fonda in the movie <i>The China Syndrome</i>. Liberals are very picky about their admiration for Western Europe. <br><br>Now it turns out even Chernobyl wasn&#x2019;...</p><h2>Talk That Talk: An Anthology of African-American Storytelling</h2><p>Compilation of tales from Afro-American folklore. Among the storytellers included are Zora Neale Hurston, Nikki Giovanni, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Leadbelly.</p><p>Although this collection contains some fine material, it is handicapped by a lack of editorial rigor. "Oral storytelling" here includes recipes, personal recollections (of a Viet Nam vet, of Winnie Mandela's solitary confinement), historical biography, literary narrative, verse, and "rap," as well as folktales, sermons, humor, ghost stories, and love stories. The introduction claims that this volume is canonical, but no criteria for inclusion, let alone for canonicity, are provided. Its academic status is further compromised by a lack of scholarship: there is no index of tale types or collection documentation, no bibliography or notes on sources or distribution. The commentaries, however thoughtful, are not scholarly. Native Americans (among others) may be surprised to learn that oral storytelling was "brought into the Americas by African captives."

And this follow-up to the hugely successful <i>Altered Art</i> will fulfill their creative desires. It moves into uncharted territory, focusing not on books, but on transforming the surfaces of a multitude of everyday objects into artistic canvases. The 25 projects clearly prove that the possibilities are limited only by one&#x2019;s own imagination. For example, in the hands of five different crafters, those ubiquitous mint tins become a small shrine, necklace, photo book, and doll. Profusely illustrated profiles showcase ten contemporary artists doing their work; all provide invaluable insights into the creative process.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>Curious crafters might want to--although it is not mandatory, by any means--begin with the author's helpful primary book on the subject, <i>Altered Art </i>(2004), before looking at this delightful follow-up volume, which takes readers further into the craft. Altered art is a fast-growing one; it entails transforming almost any object that is readily found--and often overlooked--into a two- or three-dimensional artwork. As Taylor indicates in his introduction, altered art can be something as unprofound as a pair of old scissors mounted on an interesting cutting board. A specialist in the craft, Taylor here features his own projects as well as those from two dozen other specialists in altered art. A fascinating world of creativity and imagination awaits the crafter who pores over these pages: a mint tin turns into a visual tribute to a loved one, and a vintage shoe last (that old wooden foot-shaped item people used to place inside shoes to kept them in shape) becomes a mesmerizing sculpture. <i>Brad Hooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Lowery claims that two of his employees, amateur golfers Harvie Ward and Ken Venturi, cannot be beaten in a best-ball match. Lowery challenges Coleman to bring any two golfers of his choice to the course at 10 a.m. the next day to settle the issue. Coleman accepts the challenge and shows up with his own power team: Ben Hogan and Byron Nelson, the game&#39;s greatest living professionals, with fourteen major championships between them.</p><p></p><h2>The Greatest Thing In the World (The Tarcher Family Inspriational Library)</h2><p><b>A new edition of the devotional classic&nbsp;for all&nbsp;following the Christian faith who&nbsp;seek to live a life of love</b><i></i>&nbsp;<i>You have life before you. Once only you can live it. What is the noblest object of desire, the supreme gift to covet?</i>&nbsp;Perhaps the most famous exposition of Paul's message of love to the Corinthian church, Scottish writer Henry Drummond wrote this short meditation in 1874. Widely read and quoted in his lifetime, it sold&nbsp;more than 12&nbsp;million copies and remains a much-loved devotional classic today, laying out the foundation of the gospel: that love, of God and of one another, is&nbsp;the highest calling. This new edition includes 10 of his most significant addresses.</p><p><p>The need for genuine Christian love is greater than ever&#x2014;and this beautiful classic will show readers just how to share God&#x2019;s love with their world.

Here, in a remarkable discussion of our hunter-gatherer ancestry and the &#x201c;paradoxical&#x201d; mode of perception that it involved, Berman shows how a sense of alertness, or secular/sacred immediacy, subsequently got buried by the rise of sedentary civilization, religion, and vertical power relationships.<br><br>In an integrated tour de force, Wandering God explores the meaning of Paleolithic art, the origins of social inequality, the nature of cross-cultural child rearing, the relationship between women and agriculture, and the world view of present-day nomadic peoples, as well as the emergence of &#x201c;paradoxical&#x201d; consciousness in the philosophical writings of the twentieth century.</p><p>In <i>Wandering God</i>, counterculture scholar Morris Berman goes counter-counterculture, taking on such hallowed figures as Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell. Following the lead of Bruce Chatwin's <i>Songlines</i>, Berman discovers the natural state of humanity in our nomadic origins, taking us back not to the early civilizations and their myths but to our Paleolithic ancestors. While debunking Jung and Campbell, Berman draws on a range of anthropological studies to show civilization itself to be pathological, and religion and mysticism to be a coping response. What is natural, he says, is living in paradox, with a heightened sensitivity to our surroundings, in the timeless uncertainty of moment-to-moment living. Leaning toward what one might consider a Daoist or Zen sensibility, Berman serves up persuasive arguments, and his use of sources from Bernadette Roberts to Ludwig Wittgenstein are nothing short of virtuosic. However, his entire theory seems to stand or fall on whether one accepts the immense causal influence of the Freudian notion of infantile attachment, which, if not subject to the same types of methodological criticism he aims at Jung and Campbell, is at least vulnerable to a Wittgensteinian disentanglement. Berman admits that his theory is preliminary, and <i>Wandering God</i> should be read in that spirit. <i>--Brian Bruya</i><p>Morris Berman is the author of Social Change and Scientific Organization; and the first two volumes of the trilogy on the evolution of human consciousness, The Reenchantment of the World and Coming to Our Senses: Body and Spirit in the Hidden History of the West.

It is a radical retelling of the entirety of biblical history from the devil&#39;s perspective. The devil&#39;s charge is that he is not evil; in fact, he despises it. Rather, what he opposes is God&#39;s tolerance of the existence of evil and suffering that plagues mankind and that in the beginning God, allegedly, had no interest in inviting man into His company in heaven. Memnoch - in a long story short - becomes the servant of humanity (and God) working to usher lost souls into Heaven. He invites Lestat to join him in the fight against evil and to bring all human souls from the gloom of Sheol to the paradise of Heaven.</p><p>The fifth volume of Rice's Vampire Chronicles is one of her most controversial books. The tale begins in New York, where Lestat, the coolest of Rice's vampire heroes, is stalking a big-time cocaine dealer and religious-art smuggler--this guy should get it in the neck. Lestat is also growing fascinated with the dealer's lovely daughter, a TV evangelist who's not a fraud. <p> Lestat is also being stalked himself, by some shadowy guy who turns out to be Memnoch, the devil, who spirits him away. From here on, the book might have been called <i>Interview with the Devil (by a Vampire)</i>. It's a rousing story interrupted by a long debate with the devil. Memnoch isn't the devil as ordinarily conceived: he got the boot from God because he objected to God's heartless indifference to human misery. Memnoch takes Lestat to heaven, hell, and throughout history.</p><p> Some readers are appalled by the scene in which Lestat sinks his fangs into the throat of Christ on the cross, but the scene is not a mere shock tactic: Jesus is giving Lestat a bloody taste in order to win him over to God's side, and Rice is dead serious about the battle for his soul. Rice is really doing what she did as a devout young Catholic girl asked to imagine in detail what Christ's suffering felt like--it's just that her imagination ran away with her.</p><p> If you like straight-ahead fanged adventure, you'll likely enjoy the first third; if you like Job-like arguments with God, you'll prefer the Memnoch chapters. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>In Anne Rice's extraordinary novel, the Vampire Lestat--outsides, canny monster, hero-wanderer--is at last offered the chance to be redeemed.<p>He is brought into direct confrontation with both God and the Devil, and into the land of Death.</p><p>We are in New York. The city is blanketed in snow. Through the whiteness Lestat is searching for Dora, the beautiful and charismatic daughter of a drug lord, the woman who arouses Lestat's tenderness as no mortal ever has.</p><p>While torn between his vampire passions and his overwhelming love for Dora, Lestat is confronted by the most dangerous of adversaries he has yet known.</p><p>He is snatched from the world itself by the mysterious Memnoch, who claims to be the Devil. He is invited to be a witness at the Creation. He is taken like the ancient prophets into the heavenly realm and is ushered into Purgatory.</p><p>He must decide if he can believe in the Devil or in God. And finally, he must decide which, if either, he will serve.</p><p>In the first four Vampire Chronicles, Anne Rice summoned up for us worlds that are fantastic and distant, making them as resonant, real, and immediate as our own. In this, her most daring and darkest novel, she takes us, with Lestat, into the mythical world that is most important to us--into the realms of our own theology.</p></p><h2>Quantum Healing: Exploring the Frontiers of Mind/Body Medicine</h2><p>Here is an extraordinary new approach to healing by an extraordinary physician-writer -- a book filled with the mystery, wonder, and hope of people who have experienced seemingly miraculous recoveries from cancer and other serious illnesses.<br><br>Dr. Deepak Chopra, a respected New England endocrinologist, began his search for answers when he saw patients in his own practice who completely recovered after being given only a few months to live. In the mid-1980's he returned to his native India to explore Aruyveda, humanities most ancient healing tradition. Now he has brought together the current research of Wetern medicine, neuoscience, and physics with the insights of Ayurvedic theory to show that the human body is controlled by a "network of intelligence" grounded in quantum reality. Not a superficial psychological state, this intelligence lies deep enough to change the basic pattenrs that design our physiology -- with the potential to defeat cancer, heart disease, and even aging itself. in this inspiring and pioneering work, Dr. Chopra offers us both a fascinating intellectual journey and a deeply moving chronicle of hope and healing.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Early on in <i>Quantum Healing</i>, Deepak Chopra asks an interesting question: Why, when your body mends a broken arm, is it not considered a miracle, but when your body rids itself of cancer, it is? Chopra believes the two phenomena spring from the same well, that the body is capable of doing much more than we assume it can. He calls this ability to cure disease from within "quantum healing," and shows how we're all capable of it. He believes intelligence exists everywhere in our bodies, in each of our 50 trillion cells, and that therefore each cell knows how to heal itself. It's a fascinating assertion, one that remains unprovable by science but overwhelmingly true by anecdote.Deepak Chopra, M.D. is a pioneer in the field of mind-body medicine and human potential.

Thus the sailing ship of war played a significant part in the shaping of the modern world. Fighting ships were the principal instruments of national power and the largest and most complex machines of their day. This book is a comprehensive survey of their technical development from 1400 to 1860, from the advent of the three-masted ship to the eclipse of naval sail. Incorporating much new information the book deals in detail with the hull design and construction, fittings, armament, masting, rigging, and appearance of wooden warships.

It&#x2019;s rich, silky, and absolutely one of my favorite summer dishes. The trouble is that the tahini (which is made of ground sesame seeds) and oil really move this vegetable dip into troublesome terrain. It seems so light, healthy, and full of great ingredients&#x2014;but between the oil and ground seeds, it&#x2019;s really high in fat. Fat is fat. Some fat is better for you than others, but it&#x2019;s all about 120 calories a tablespoon.<br><br> Here, I&#x2019;ve backed way off on the olive oil, but maintained the traditional earthy flavor and creaminess. Eggplant thrives in the Southern summer heat, and while this dish isn&#x2019;t typically Southern, it&#x2019;s a marvelous addition to the lightened up Southern table. Eggplant is available year round in grocery stores, but they taste their meaty, hearty best in the summer.

Comprising dozens of Classic Period serapes, chief blankets, Germantown eyedazzlers, and turn-of-the-century rugs, the 185-piece collection was donated to the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History in 1942 but for the next forty years was known only to a handful of scholars. Hearst began acquiring textiles from the Fred Harvey Company after viewing an exhibit of Indian artifacts. Over four decades he amassed a collection spanning more than a century of Navajo weaving and including nearly every major type produced from 1800 to 1920. Hearst&#39;s passion for American Indian artifacts was so strong that he had originally visualized his now-famous castle in San Simeon as a showplace for his Navajo textile collection. At a time when the Harvey Company was itself influencing the development of Indian handcrafts by opening up the tourist market, Hearst contributed to this influence by expressing his own artistic preference for rare and unusual pieces. This catalogue raisonn�, featuring nearly 200 illustrations, provides the general public with the first look at this important collection. Nancy Blomberg&#39;s narrative introduces the reader to the history of Navajo weaving and documents Hearst&#39;s role in its development. The heart of the book provides a detailed analysis of each textile: fibers, yarn types, dyes, and designs. Navajo Textiles thus constitutes an invaluable reference for scholars and collectors and will be enjoyed by anyone who appreciates these beautiful creations from the Navajo loom."The rich visual feast of nearly 200 illustrations of a previously unpublished collection would be cause enough for celebration. But Blomberg has not been content to provide her readers only with photographs of beautiful and interesting weaving. She has used the collection as a point of departure to discuss and analyze this important era in the history of art. . . . <i>Navajo Textiles: The William Randolph Hearst Collection</i> offers something for everyone. It is a lavishly illustrated catalogue of a major, previously unpublished collection, a valuable scholarly resource and a rich visual feast for art lovers everywhere." &#x2014;<i>American Indian Arts</i>"This is a beautifully produced book, cataloguing and illustrating for the first time one of the outstanding collections of Navajo weaving of the last half of the nineteenth century. . . . It is of great value not only to the scholar and collector but to anyone interested in this incredible art of the Navajo Indian." &#x2014;<i>The Journal of Arizona History</i></p><h2>The Burning Maze: The Trials of Apollo, Book 3. &#39;Exclusive&#39; Edition (ISBN 9781368024068), with &#34;Apollo&#39;s Puzzle Collection&#34; Insert Tipped In.

It's been 16 years since the final moments of <i>Fortress of Dragons</i> (HarperCollins, 2000), and Cefwyn now sits on the throne as the just ruler of a tenuously united kingdom. He begins to look toward a future filled with the promise of good things he sees in his two sons: Aewyn, the 15-year-old rightful heir to the throne, and Elfwyn, an illegitimate child of Cefwyn and the dark sorceress Tarien Aswydd. Raised by the good witch Gran, Elfwyn has grown up unaware of his noble lineage. But Cefwyn claims him and takes him to live at the capital, where he becomes fast friends with his half brother. As much as Elfwyn enjoys his new life, the dark side of his parentage constantly pulls on him to release some powerful magic that could destroy everything his father worked so hard to create. Elfwyn's character, teetering so desperately between two very different paths, will draw readers into this dramatic and magical coming-of-age story. Much of the early part of the book relies on political intrigue and constant references to the history of the land; wisely, Cherryh includes a short introduction that provides a quick summary of the backstory.

The plot revolves around the fate of this bat and attempts to retrieve it, but the real focus of the novel is a vivid portrayal of school life. Though the setting is an English public school in the years before World War 1, so sharp is Wodehouse&#39;s ear for the way children talk that everyone will recognise familiar characters and situations, whatever their place of education.</p><p>Pelham Grenville Wodehouse (always known as `Plum&#39;) wrote more than ninety novels and some three hundred short stories over 73 years. He is widely recognised as the greatest 20th-century writer of humour in the English language. Perhaps best known for the escapades of Bertie Wooster and Jeeves, Wodehouse also created the world of Blandings Castle, home to Lord Emsworth and his cherished pig, the Empress of Blandings. His stories include gems concerning the irrepressible and disreputable Ukridge; Psmith, the elegant socialist; the ever-so-slightly-unscrupulous Fifth Earl of Ickenham, better known as Uncle Fred; and those related by Mr Mulliner, the charming raconteur of The Angler&#39;s Rest, and the Oldest Member at the Golf Club. In 1936 he was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for `having made an outstanding and lasting contribution to the happiness of the world&#39;. He was made a Doctor of Letters by Oxford University in 1939 and in 1975, aged 93, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. He died shortly afterwards, on St Valentine&#39;s Day.&#34;The Everyman edition promises to be a splendid celebration of the divine Plum&#34; * The Independent * &#34;A handsome, collectable hardback edition&#34; -- Lynne Truss * The Times * &#34;The incomparable and timeless genius - perfect for readers of all ages, shapes and sizes&#34; -- Kate Mosse</p><h2>My Name Is America: The Journal Of Sean Sullivan, A Transcontinental Railroad Worker</h2><p>This recent edition to the My Name Is America series presents a &#34;first-hand&#34; account of what life was like for a fifteen-year-old boy who worked on the Transcontinental Railroad in the mid-1800s alongside his father. 90,000 first printing.</p><p>In the My Name Is America series, Durbin (Wintering, 1999, etc.) offers the story of Sean Sullivan, whose first day in Omaha, Nebraska, brings him face to face with a victim of an Indian attack; the man survived, but carries his bloody scalp in a bucket. It's August 1897, and Sean has just arrived from Chicago, planning to work with his father on the Intercontinental Railroad. Pa, who carries terrible memories of his stint in the Civil War and of the death three years ago of Sean's mother, is already a foreman for the railroad, but Sean must start at the bottom, as a water carrier, toting barrels of it to the thirsty men who are doing the back-breaking work on the line. At night, everyone is usually too tired to do anything but sleep, but Sundays are free, and Sean discovers the rough and rowdy world of the towns that seem to sprout up from nowhere along the railroad's path over the prairie. Through Sean's eyes, the history of this era and the magnitude of his and his fellow workers' achievements come alive; Durbin has no trouble making Sean's world palpable, and readers will slog along with Sean every step of the way on his long and arduous journey to building a railroad and becoming a man. (b&amp;w maps, photos, reproductions) (Fiction. 8-14) -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Grade 5-8-Sean gets a job with his father at the Union Pacific Railroad. In his journal, he tells of working his way up from the lowest position of "water carrier" to "spiker" and shares plenty of railroad lingo and information about the boomtowns that he observes along the way. In the first few pages, he sees his first scalp and his first dead body in two unrelated incidents. The issue of prejudice is addressed, both in fights among various workers from Ireland, and with the deadly battles between the employees of the U.P. and the Chinese workers from the Central Pacific line. The role of the press in the races between the two railroads to lay the most track in the shortest time and the fact that much of the U.P. track was so poorly set that it was replaced soon after is noted. Sean is a likable protagonist who notices the small details and reacts to things realistically. A section of notes includes history, period photographs, maps, and other information.<br><i>Sharon R.

On the surface, it may seem to be in decline. However, the evidence of discrimination persists throughout our society. Segregation and inequalities in education, housing, health care, and the job market continue to be the norm. Post 9/11, increased insecurity and fear have led to an epidemic of the scapegoating and harassment of people of color.</p> <p><i>Uprooting Racism </i>offers a framework for understanding institutional racism. It provides practical suggestions, tools, examples, and advice on how white people can intervene in interpersonal and organizational situations to work as allies for racial justice. Completely revised and updated, this expanded third edition directly engages the reader through questions, exercises, and suggestions for action, and takes a detailed look at current issues such as affirmative action, immigration, and health care. It also includes a wealth of information about specific cultural groups such as Muslims, people with mixed-heritage, Native Americans, Jews, recent immigrants, Asian Americans, and Latinos.</p> <p>Previous editions of <i>Uprooting Racism </i>have sold more than fifty thousand copies.

Working with American Ballet Theatre (where he was Artistic Director for ten years), the New York City Ballet (with George Ballanchine), and finally forming his own company in 1990 with Mark Morris, White Oak Dance Project, Baryshnikov has, over these past decades, changed the face of dance.</p><p><i>Baryshnikov in Black and White</i> presents, in over 175 photographs, the remarkable breadth of his achievement between the years 1974 and 2000.

But few could guess that his experimental spirit would lead him from princely roles in the classics to trailblazing collaborations with modern dance choreographers. <i>Baryshnikov in Black and White</i> reveals key moments of the dancer's artistic evolution from 1974 to 2000 in more than 175 starkly expressive black-and-white photographs. Glimpses of performances with American Ballet Theatre, New York City Ballet, and the White Oak Dance Project join a few well-chosen studio rehearsal shots. They demonstrate Baryshnikov's enormous range, from the classical purity of <i>Apollo</i> to the improvisational <i>HeartBeat: mb</i>, from partnering Natalia Makarova to partnering a folding chair. Joan Acocella's introduction deftly and authoritatively sketches the dancer's career. Unfortunately, Robert Greskovic's annotated captions are segregated from the photos, requiring constant paging back and forth. <i>--Cathy Curtis</i><i>Baryshnikov in Black and White</i> presents, in over 175 photographs, the remarkable breadth of his achievement between the years 1974 and 2000.

This new selection, edited by his former student Thom Gunn, presents all of the essential poems of Winters&#x2019; idiosyncratic career, from his early Imagist experiments to his final meditative masterpieces. Rigorous, impassioned, and austere, these poems offer vivid proof that, as Gunn puts it, &#x201c;The life of poetry is not just contained but is defined by its form.&#x201d;<br><br><b>About the American Poets Project</b><br>Elegantly designed in compact editions, printed on acid-free paper, and textually authoritative, the American Poets Project makes available the full range of the American poetic accomplishment, selected and introduced by today&#x2019;s most discerning poets and critics.</p><p><b>Thom Gunn</b>&nbsp;(1929&#x2013;2004) studied with Yvor Winters at Stanford University and was a senior lecturer at the University of California at Berkeley. He published more than 30 books of poetry in the United States and Britain, including&nbsp;<i>Collected Poems</i>&nbsp;(1994) and&nbsp;<i>Boss Cupid</i>&nbsp;(2000).To Thom Gunn, the foremost Britain-to-America transplant poet of his generation (Auden was his great forebear in a previous generation), falls the task of re-presenting Winters (1900-67), one of the most famous critics and teachers of his lifetime, whose poetry was then more respected than discussed. Now it seems to be some of the best from his generation of American poets. His early work, which Gunn represents far more generously than R. L. Barth did in <i>The Selected Poems of Yvor Winters</i> (1999), exemplifies imagism at its best, and it is based in the American West rather than the classical Greece that predominates in the work of H. D., the best imagist, Winters' later, formally precise poetry is elegant, allusive, profound, and rather dour, demanding careful reading and rereading and always repaying the effort. Adding immense value to this edition is the inclusion of an autobiographical story with an eerie account of self-confrontation in which Gunn sees the pivot between Winters' early and late poetic styles. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

If you're interested in the decorative arts, landscaping ideas abound, as do instructions for making potpourri, herb pillows, and other fragrant decorations. Therapeutic uses are covered in detail and are cross-referenced with the ailments for which these herbs have been deemed effective. And with additional information on aromatherapy and instructions for making tinctures, teas, ointments, and creams, herbal healing constitutes an essential and invaluable component of this reference.

Left untouched were many of the things known to cause cancer, including tobacco, the workplace, radiation, or the global environment. Proof of how the world in which we live and work affects whether we get cancer was either overlooked or suppressed. This has been no accident. The War on Cancer was run by leaders of industries that made cancer-causing products, and sometimes also profited from drugs and technologies for finding and treating the disease. Filled with compelling personalities and never-before-revealed information, <i>The Secret History of the War on Cancer</i> shows how we began fighting the wrong war, with the wrong weapons, against the wrong enemies-a legacy that persists to this day.

In 1926 she moved to Stockholm where she found work as a secretary. She did not begin writing until 1944 when, immobilized with a sprained ankle, she began to set down the Pippi Longstocking stories she had invented over the years to entertain her daughter, Karin. Her first book (Britt-Mari Opens Her Heart) was published by Rab�n &amp; Sj�gren that same year, followed by <i>Pippi Longstocking</i> in 1945. Free-spirited and super�naturally strong in all respects, Pippi was an immediate favorite of Swedish schoolchildren, and her popularity only increased with the tales of her adventures that followed. In 1946, Lindgren became an editor and then the head of the children&#x2019;s book department at Rab�n &amp; Sj�gren, a role she held for the next twenty-four years, living in Stockholm and spending summers on her beloved island of Furusund in the Stockholm archipelago. After the Pippi series, Lindgren wrote many fairy tales and picture books, in addition to further chapter books, including <i>Seacrow Island</i> (1964; published by The New York Review Children&#x2019;s Collection) and <i>Ronia, the Robber&#x2019;s Daughter </i>(1981).

She divides her time between Cambridge and Cape Cod, Massachusetts.<br>Marla Frazee (www.marlafrazee.com) has illustrated all of the Clementine books as well as many other popular titles. She was awarded a Caldecott Honor on two occasions, for <em>All the World</em> by Liz Garton Scanlon, and for <em>A Couple of Boys Have the Best Week Ever</em>, which she also wrote. She lives in Pasadena, California, where she works in a small backyard cabin under an avocado tree.Popular Clementine is back, but the question is, how popular is she with her classmates? She's been chosen Friend of the Week, but will the kids find enough nice things to write about in her friendship booklet? Best friend Margaret, a grade older, gets all weird when the topic of the booklet comes up. Pennypacker does a fine job of juggling a number of plotlines, especially when she ties the friendship booklet to Clementine's missing kitten. Fans won't be disappointed, and readers new to the series will enjoy this, too. Booklist"<br><br>Third-grader Clementine is gearing up for her reign as Friend of the Week. She will get to be the all-around helper in class and her classmates will sign her Friend of the Week booklet, writing reasons "why it's so great to have [her] around." All is well until fourth-grader Margaret brags that her own book was filled with compliments about her organization, cleanliness, and helpfulness. Clementine knows she won't get comments like those unless she takes action. Following Margaret's suggestion, our heroine sets out to pay compliments in order to guarantee some nice words in return. But, being Clementine, she has to do more, including drawing free-of-charge tattoos and promising all the decorations in her dad's closet for bicycle decorations for a bike rally. Clementine's campaign comes to a halt when her beloved kitten, Moisturizer, goes missing. Her new skills are now put to the real test as she, along with an unlikely helper, search for her pet. Readers will empathize with Clementine's emotional response to her missing cat and will cheer as she learns some things about herself and her best friend. Secondary characters, particularly older boy Mitchell and Clementine's understanding parents, add much to Clementine's life and make this a worthy addition to an already-excellent series. Horn Book"<br><br>Clementine is back for another adventure as she is chosen to be "Friend of the Week." The honor has many important responsibilities such as leading the Pledge of Allegiance, collecting milk money, being line leader, and feeding the fish. At the end of the week, the third grader will get a friend booklet signed by all of her classmates telling her how much they appreciate her. Clementine's best friend, fourth-grader Margaret, advises her to give compliments to classmates all week so she'll get good comments in her booklet. The following day Clementine starts giving them to every person she comes in contact with, primarily based on appearance, which doesn't always work out as she planned. Just as she looks forward to the best week ever, things take a turn for the worse when her kitten goes missing. She forgets all about her promises to decorate her classmates' bikes for a bike rally and is afraid they will be disappointed in her. Little does she know how much they support and love her. Pennypacker's writing once again brings creativity, humor, and sensitivity to Clementine and her world. Black-and-white line illustrations grace the book, capturing the child's personality and varied emotions. A must-have for most collections. Fans will be in for another fun serving of their favorite girl named after a fruit.

"Jazz" and "poker," "sucker" and "scam" all derive from Irish. While demonstrating this, Daniel Cassidy simultaneously traces the hidden history of how Ireland fashioned America, not just linguistically, but through the Irish gambling underworld, urban street gangs, and the powerful political machines that grew out of them. Cassidy uncovers a secret national heritage, long discounted by our WASP-dominated culture.</p><p> <b>Daniel Cassidy</b> is the founder and co-director of the Irish Studies Program at New College in San Francisco.</p></p><p>Daniel Cassidy is founder and co-director of An L�ann �ireannach, the Irish Studies Program at New College of California in San Francisco.

The promise is that we will soon be able to treat and prevent a host of debilitating diseases. The predicament is that our newfound genetic knowledge may enable us to manipulate our nature--to enhance our genetic traits and those of our children. Although most people find at least some forms of genetic engineering disquieting, it is not easy to articulate why. What is wrong with re-engineering our nature? </p><p> <i>The Case against Perfection</i> explores these and other moral quandaries connected with the quest to perfect ourselves and our children. Michael Sandel argues that the pursuit of perfection is flawed for reasons that go beyond safety and fairness. The drive to enhance human nature through genetic technologies is objectionable because it represents a bid for mastery and dominion that fails to appreciate the gifted character of human powers and achievements. Carrying us beyond familiar terms of political discourse, this book contends that the genetic revolution will change the way philosophers discuss ethics and will force spiritual questions back onto the political agenda. </p><p> In order to grapple with the ethics of enhancement, we need to confront questions largely lost from view in the modern world. Since these questions verge on theology, modern philosophers and political theorists tend to shrink from them. But our new powers of biotechnology make these questions unavoidable. Addressing them is the task of this book, by one of America's preeminent moral and political thinkers. </p></p><p>Michael J. Sandel is the Anne T. and Robert M. Bass Professor of Government, Harvard University, and the author most recently of <i>Public Philosophy</i> (Harvard).Sandel explores a paramount question of our era: how to extend the power and promise of biomedical science to overcome debility without compromising our humanity. His arguments are acute and penetrating, melding sound logic with compassion. We emerge from this book feeling edified and inspired.<br> --Jerome Groopman, Harvard Medical School, author of <i>How Doctors Think</i><br><br>We live in a world, says Michael Sandel, where "science moves faster than moral understanding." But thanks to Sandel, moral understanding is catching up.

And then he'll tell you whether you should be.<br> --Michael Kinsley<br><br>In this short and provocative treatise, Sandel, who is professor of government at Harvard and a member of the President's Council on Bioethics, takes on the question of why certain kinds of newly available genetic technologies make us uneasy...[his] book reminds us that the proper starting point for bioethics is not, "what should we do?" but rather, "what kind of society do we want?" And "what kind of people are we?"<br> --Faith McLellan (<i>The Scientist</i> 2007-04-01)<br><br><i>The Case against Perfection</i> by Michael Sandel is a brief, concise, and dazzling argument by one of America's foremost moral and political thinkers that brings you up to speed on the core ethical issues informing current debates about genetic engineering and stem cell research.<br> --Gabriel Gbadamosi (<i>BBC Radio</i>)<br><br>In the future, genetic manipulation of embryos is expected to have the potential to go beyond the treatment of diseases to improvements: children who are taller, more athletic, and have higher IQs...In <i>The Case against Perfection</i>, Michael Sandel argues that the unease many people feel about such manipulations have a basis in reason...This beautifully crafted little book...quickly and clearly lays out the key issues at stake.<br> --Gregory M. Lamb (<i>Christian Science Monitor</i>)<br><br>Given the vast gulf between progressive and conservative thinking, the time is ripe for a philosopher to take on the issues of biotechnology.

She is best known for the three children's novels Little Lord Fauntleroy (published in 1885&#x2013;1886), A Little Princess (1905), and The Secret Garden (1911). Frances Eliza Hodgson was born in Cheetham, England. After her father died in 1852, the family fell on straitened circumstances and in 1865 immigrated to the United States, settling near Knoxville, Tennessee. There Frances began writing to help earn money for the family, publishing stories in magazines from the age of 19. In 1870, her mother died, and in 1872 Frances married Swan Burnett, who became a medical doctor. The Burnetts lived for two years in Paris, where their two sons were born, before returning to the United States to live in Washington, D.C., Burnett then began to write novels, the first of which (That Lass o' Lowrie's), was published to good reviews. Little Lord Fauntleroy was published in 1886 and made her a popular writer of children's fiction, although her romantic adult novels written in the 1890s were also popular. She wrote and helped to produce stage versions of Little Lord Fauntleroy and A Little Princess. Burnett enjoyed socializing and lived a lavish lifestyle. Beginning in the 1880s, she began to travel to England frequently and in the 1890s bought a home there where she wrote The Secret Garden. Her oldest son, Lionel, died of tuberculosis in 1890, which caused a relapse of the depression she had struggled with for much of her life. She divorced Swan Burnett in 1898, married Stephen Townsend in 1900, and divorced him in 1902. A few years later she settled in Nassau County, Long Island, where she died in 1924 and is buried in Roslyn Cemetery. In 1936 a memorial sculpture by Bessie Potter Vonnoh was erected in her honour in Central Park's Conservatory Garden. The statue depicts her two famous Secret Garden characters, Mary and Dickon.</p><h2>Knockdown</h2><p>For a generous commission, ex-prize-winning jockey Jonah Dereham agrees to bid on a special horse for a wealth American lady.

Staton Rabin lives in Irvington, New York.<b>Chapter One</b><br><br>I opened my bedroom window and inhaled -- deeply, joyfully. That familiar, intoxicating odor: night on St. Helena. The sickly-sweet smell of guava and roses hung in the air like ether, just as I'd remembered it. Who would have thought I'd be so glad to return to the place my father and his navy comrades called "Hell in the South Atlantic"?<br><br>It was the autumn of 1815. I had been home again at the Briars just three days, from Hawthorne Boarding School in London. I'd shocked my parents by not misbehaving once since my return to St. Helena. Perhaps they believed the knuckle-rapping, head-thumping headmistress of Hawthorne had finally knocked some sense into their younger daughter. I began to wonder it myself. <i>Blast!</i> Had I lost my sense of adventure? Would I go soft and ladylike and marry some vain, boot-polished officer of the Fifty-fourth Regiment or His Majesty's Navy -- as my sister Jane hoped to do?<br><br>Just then two booms of the cannon from the port at Jamestown -- the signal for a ship's arrival -- broke the stillness. And I knew I remained the Betsy Balcombe of yore. Older, yes. Wiser, perhaps. But never, never willing to settle for a life that's "Tedious-as-Hell in the South Atlantic"!<br><br>I threw on my bed jacket and grabbed hold of my ladder -- the vine that had, over the years, crept bravely up the red brick walls of the Briars and to the very edge of my windowsill. It was many a night that the vine had been my ladder to adventure. Thank heaven Toby hadn't trimmed it back during my long absence!<br><br>I slipped a little as I climbed out the window, and Jane woke with a start. She gave a quiet, girlish scream. I looked over at her, and she was sitting up in her white lacy canopy bed, the covers pulled tight under her chin. I had one leg out the window. My sister glared at me, stern as the headmistress of Hawthorne.<br><br>"I'll tell...," Jane threatened coolly.<br><br>"Still the little tattler," I said, shaking my head. Jane was sixteen -- two years older than I; old enough to keep secrets.<br><br>"You're going into Jamestown, aren't you?"<br><br>"Go back to sleep, Jane. If you don't, you'll make your eyes all puffy and you'll turn ugly so none of the young officers will want to marry you."<br><br>"Betsy!"<br><br>"Good night, Jane."<br><br>It was too late for her to stop me. I was already out the window and halfway down the vine. Jane would never think of spoiling her pretty hands by attempting to climb down after me.<br><br>I jumped the last few feet to the ground. Then I peered around the corner of the Briars to see who was about. Most of our slaves had already returned to their cabins for the night. Most of the soldiers had turned in too, though there seemed to be a few more sentries on watch than usual.<br><br>I rounded the corner of the Briars and dashed to the moon-shaded side of the Pavilion veranda. Suddenly, I heard footsteps in the dank leaves nearby. I froze, listening, trying to quiet my winded breathing so it wouldn't betray me. <br><br>"Is me. Only me, missy."<br><br><i>Toby!</i> I'd forgotten the old man liked to stroll by night in the gardens he tended by day. He liked to drink a bit of the island rum too. Not enough to get drunk, though. I breathed a sigh of relief.<br><br>"You go for the walk at night -- like old time, missy, yes?"<br><br>"Yes." I still couldn't see him, but I smelled the rum on his breath. I knew he'd be smiling broadly at me with those remarkably white teeth I used to think were a string of pearls from the seas off his native Haiti.<br><br>"Miss Jane with you?"<br><br>I laughed. "What do you think?"<br><br>"Didn't think yes, missy," he said, chuckling softly. "Didn't think yes."<br><br>Toby had been with my family for years and had seen Jane and me grow up. But I knew I was his favorite -- even more than the boys.<br><br>After a moment he whispered hoarsely: "Ship is here, in Jamestown. Do you know?"<br><br>"I heard the signal."<br><br>Toby fell silent. Then he sighed and whispered seriously: "All will be very different, St. Helena now. Everything soon change, missy, yes?"<br><br>I didn't know what Toby meant. He often said things that sounded mysterious. I knew the island slaves to be very superstitious, so I never took much notice.<br><br>"Your papa ask me to cut vines all over," he said with a chuckle. "I leave the one outside missy's window for you coming home."<br><br>So Toby knew how I'd escaped from my room at night, and he'd kept my secret! I'd always felt he was one of the few people who understood me.<br><br>"Thank you, Toby!"<br><br>"Hush!" he whispered. "You wake family all, no Jamestown, no ship to see for missy."<br><br>"Good night, Toby," I whispered back, and ran toward Jamestown.<br><br>Copyright � 2004 by Staton Rabin</p><h2>Henri Cartier-Bresson: � Propos de Paris</h2><p>Photography is nothing, it&#39;s life that interests me.--Henri Cartier-Bresson. A PROPOS DE PARIS presents the renowned photographer&#39;s personal selection of more than 130 of his best photographs of Paris taken over 50 years. This is a unique gallery of urban landscapes rendered by a great sensibility. 131 illustrations.</p><p>"Photography is nothing, it's life that interests me." With his ever-present Leica camera, Henri Cartier-Bresson captured the raw and the sweet, the comic and the profound moments of lives that were lost in the grind or relegated to someone else's memory--the coincidental moment at which a reflection in a puddle of water mimics a poster on a nearby wall or when lovers kiss, oblivious to the not-so-pristine world around them. It is the familiar beauty and cruelty of the day-to-day that is so engaging in his photographs: two cosmopolitan woman chat nonchalantly while surrounded by empty lettuce crates; mourners at a funeral stare directly into the camera; postwar Paris awakens in the fog. Cartier-Bresson was the master of the "decisive moment," that fleeting instant for which a picture really is worth a thousand words, which is the essence of photojournalism. In no place is this more exemplified than in his images of Paris.<p> Cartier-Bresson personally selected the more than 130 black-and-white photographs of Paris for this publication. With photographs taken over a period of 50 years, the work is beautifully and generously printed in duotone. The accompanying essays, both short and unobtrusive, are also familiar and personal. One essayist captures the essence of Cartier-Bresson's camera work: "When life calls, he is always there, to assist, or to admire; to rebel, or to say no to exploiters and imposters, and to all those who demean its value." <i>--Manine Golden</i></p>Henri Cartier-Bresson is one of this century&#39;s leading photographers and his career has profoundly influenced the field. His earliest images are of Europe in the 1930s and 40s; he later traveled throughout the world -- to the United States, India, Japan, China, Mexico, the Soviet Union -- to frame the world with his camera.</p><h2>The Awkward Thoughts of W.

I loved them in all of their forms. I loved comic books, action figures, superhero movies, and even superhero TV shows. And I was born in 1973, so superhero TV shows were weird. Take the 1970s <i>Spider-Man </i>TV show. Spider-Man wore his web shooters on the <i>outside </i>of his costume because apparently the producers thought they were too big and clunky to fit on the <i>inside </i>of his costume. And also (apparently) the makers of the TV show didn&#x2019;t think that we, the watchers of the TV show, would suspend our disbelief long enough for the producers to make the <i>fake </i>web shooters small enough to put them inside the <i>pretend, not-real, made-up freaking costume where they belong</i>!<br><br> There was also <i>The Incredible Hulk</i>. A TV show that I LOVED.<br><br> LOVED! LOVED! LOVED! I loved it so much that my mom cut up old clothes of mine that I could wear while watching the show so that when Dr. David Banner &#x201c;Hulked out,&#x201d; I could &#x201c;Hulk out&#x201d; too. I know you are thinking that it sounds adorable. But it wasn&#x2019;t. I was six years old, and I was a very ferocious Hulk. Very ferocious. You&#x2019;ll just have to take my word for it. The Polaroids have all been destroyed.<br><br> <i>The Incredible Hulk </i>was a TV show that could only have been born of the 1970s. At its core it was one of comic books&#x2019; greatest stories. It was Stan Lee and Marvel Comics&#x2019;s twist on <i>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde </i>with a whole lot of <i>Frankenstein </i>thrown in. The Hulk was invented in the throes of the Cold War and America was learning to live in constant fear of nuclear annihilation. A puny&#x2014;that was the word that the comic often used to describe him&#x2014;scientist named Dr. Bruce Banner got exposed to way too much gamma radiation while saving a young man from an explosion of gamma radiation. This was a simpler time in superheroes that I honestly miss. Back then, a comic book writer could just write "bathed in radiation," and the reader would say to themselves,&nbsp;<i>WELL OF COURSE! THAT'S DEFINITELY GOING TO LEAD TO MAGICAL POWERS AND NOT SOME FORM OF LYMPHOMA! </i>People had more room for mystery back then. Now we know too much. The reason that every modern Super� man movie sucks is because we all sit in the audience thinking, So <i>wait ... Lois is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and she can't figure out that the key to Superman's secret identity is glasses?<br></i><br> The 1970s were the last time that Superman made sense on the big screen. And the original <i>Superman </i>movie is still better than every other one since (special effects notwithstanding). I loved that movie. In fact, if you asked me who my favorite actor was in 1978, when it came out, I would have instantly said, "Christopher Reeve!" Even though I had never seen a movie where he played someone other than Superman. But when I love something I go all in. It's tunnel vision. And it's annoying. All my friends know who my favorite bands are (Living Colour, Fishbone, and Rage Against the Machine); favorite athletes (Michael Jordan and Muhammad Ali); favorite, ummm ... Bruce Lee (Bruce Lee); comedians (Bill Hicks, Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle, Robert Hawkins, Dwayne Kennedy); and actors (as a kid, Christopher Reeve, and as an adult, Denzel Washington, aka the Greatest Actor of All Time Period). And in 1977 my favorite TV show was <i>The Incredible Hulk, </i>and my second favorite TV show was <i>The Dukes of Hazzard</i>, where every week the bright orange car named the General Lee, with the Confederate flag painted on top, would save the day as the two hillbillies, Bo and Luke, inevitably screamed, &#x201c;YEE-HAW!!!&#x201d; My mom was so proud.<br><br> But back to superheroes. The reason why the 1970s were the last time <i>Superman </i>made sense as a movie is that the 1970s were also the time when Hollywood got dark and cynical. It was the rise of the auteur as filmmaker. People like Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, Stanley Kubrick, and many others. Even Steven Spielberg decided to scare the shit out of us all with <i>Jaws</i>. And clearly the creators of <i>The Incredible Hulk </i>TV show were all about this darkness too. They took a simple comic book tale that every comic book fan could relate to (puny guy gets pushed to anger and turns into a huge green monster), and they ladled heaps and heaps of the 1970s on it. Actor Bill Bixby played the scientist David Banner. (Reportedly, the makers of the show renamed the character because they thought the name &#x201c;Bruce&#x201d; sounded too &#x201c;gay,&#x201d; because &#x201c;puny&#x201d; is one thing, but &#x201c;gay&#x201d; was too weird.) Bixby played David as totally tortured and drowning in guilt. He was on the run from the &#x201c;sin&#x201d; of turning himself into a destructive green monster. Later, when I watched reruns of the show as an adult, I could tell that Bixby thought he was a much better actor than the show allowed him to be. He often had the look of the actor who wanted to be acting up against DeNiro and Pacino but got stuck in TV due to his roles in <i>My Favorite Martian </i>and <i>The Courtship of Eddie&#x2019;s Father</i>. There was a little &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe this shit&#x201d; in his face. The same way Harrison Ford looks throughout the first three <i>Star Wars </i>movies, as opposed to how he looks in the 2015&nbsp;<i>Star Wars </i>movie: &#x201c;Thanks for calling me!&#x201d;<br><br> The tone of <i>The Incredible Hulk </i>was dark. The soundtrack was not the soundtrack of a fun "superhero show." It was a soundtrack filled with mourning and melancholy. And the theme song was all anxiety and foreboding, and had a sullen voice-over that reeked of terror. Whenever David was pushed into "hulking out," he was riddled with regret for what he was about to do as the Hulk.<br><br> Bodybuilder Lou Ferrigno played David's alter ego, the Hulk, as a reluctant monster. In the comic books, the Hulk was partially a comedic character, full of malapropisms and broken sentences like "HULK SMASH!" But on TV, the Hulk didn't talk. He just wailed plaintively. And the end of every show was virtually exactly the same. It featured David skulking out of town, walking down a road (usually a freeway), thumbing for rides, while the music ended on a dissonant note of dread. There was no "YAY! The hero has saved the day again!" And just to fully set it in the 1970s, David was skulking out of town in... bell-bottoms. And that shows you how great an actor Bill Bixby was. Bell-bottoms are the single most difficult item of clothing to wear while also skulking.<br><br> So even though CBS had taken my simple monster tale and turned it into <i>Midnight Cowboy </i>minus prostitution plus a six-foot� five-inch bodybuilder slathered in green body paint (not to say that a six-foot-five-inch bodybuilder slathered in green paint can't par�ticipate in prostitution too)&#x2014;I LOVED IT! I loved it because no matter how much of the 1970s the producers ladled on the show, the core of it still remained. A person (Banner) who felt powerless and bullied (who knew deep inside that he was smarter and more sensitive than the bullies) could rise up against the bullies as his alter ego (the Hulk). It was literally every comic book geek's dream: <i>No one understands how smart and cool/ am. But if they keep pushing </i>me, <i>I'll show them.<br></i><br> My love of the Hulk and Spider-Man lasted through my teenage years. Superman got left behind in the &#x2019;70s. I still watched the movies when they came out, but I didn&#x2019;t buy the comic books. Superman becomes boring real fast. He&#x2019;s too strong. Too powerful. He is invulnerable. And his weakness is boring. It&#x2019;s a rock. A rock from his home planet, Krypton. Who cares? I couldn&#x2019;t relate to being invulnerable. I was a Black kid growing up in America.<br><br> The Hulk and Spider-Man were regular people who had extraordinary abilities. I was also a regular person. I also had extraordinary abilities . . . I mean, I thought I did . . . I hoped I did. And there was something else here too. The Hulk and Spider-Man weren&#x2019;t white. I mean, yes, they were white people. David Banner and Peter Parker were both white men (OK, Spider-Man was a teenager when he began his superhero career), but when they were superheroes, the Hulk was green (usually with purple pants) and Spider-Man was mostly red and blue. You didn&#x2019;t know if Spider-Man was white or Black. When the Hulk showed up, nobody said, &#x201c;Sure, he looks green. But I bet that when he calms down, he whitens up good.&#x201d;<br><br> That meant, as a kid, I could easily envision being Spider-Man or the Hulk. Everybody knew Superman was white. Everybody knew Batman was white. And those were the big four superheroes when I was a kid. And yes, there were a few Black superheroes around when I was a kid, but nobody really cared about them. They were side dishes to the main-course superheroes. There was Black Lightning, Black Vulcan, the Black Panther . . . Notice anything? Yep, when I was a kid it seemed like every Black superhero had to have the word &#x201c;Black&#x201d; in their name. Like it wasn&#x2019;t enough that they <i>were </i>Black. It wasn&#x2019;t enough that their <i>skin </i>was Black. There was seemingly some sort of contractual obligation to put the word "Black" in their superhero name. (Bill Cosby made fun of this idea on his cartoon <i>Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids </i>by naming their favorite superhero the Brown Hornet.) Later, when I grew up, I discovered a Black hero named Blue Marvel, but the only way he got away with not using "Black" in his name was to cover his face so you couldn't see his skin. And there is a story in the comic book that once President Kennedy discovers that the Blue Marvel is actually Black, he asks him to retire, because I guess a president having an affair with Marilyn Monroe is one thing, but a BLACK SUPERHERO? ARE YOU CRAZY?<br><br> Creating Black superheroes with the word "Black" in their names was a way for America to once again normalize whiteness. It wasn't <i>"White </i>Superman" or <i>"White </i>Batman" or <i>"White </i>Green Lantern." Because "white" is normal. White doesn't need to be mentioned. But "Black," on the other hand, needs to be announced. To me, it made the superheroes sound less intimidating, less powerful, less normal than their white counterparts. I think some of that had to do with my own feelings at the time about being Black.<br><br> I was growing up in post-' 60s Civil Rights-era America. I had been taught that Martin Luther King Jr. had ended racism one day when he and his friends took a long walk. But something didn't feel right about that. If racism was over, why was mom always referring to white people as "crackers"? Early on in my stand-up act, I had a joke where I said that I was eleven years old before I realized that a cracker was also a delicious snack. I was joking, but just barely. The best kind of joke. And that's what these "Black <i>Black" </i>superhero names felt like: a joke.<br><br> Think of the absolute ludicrousness of a superhero putting his own race in his superhero name. You can choose ANY NAME. And you choose something with &#x201c;Black&#x201d; in it? The whole idea of taking on a superhero name is to protect your secret identity, AND IN YOUR ALIAS YOU ARE GIVING OUT CLUES TO WHO YOU ARE??? It would be like if instead of Clark Kent just naming himself Superman, he called himself &#x201c;Superman . . . you know . . . from Smallville.&#x201d; Putting &#x201c;Black&#x201d; in the name just felt corny to me when I was a kid. And that corniness made it obvious that these characters were being created by people who weren&#x2019;t Black. It went so far that there was actually a white superhero named Goliath, and when his powers ended up in a Black guy, the Black guy&#x2019;s superhero name was Black Goliath. I have no words for how dumb that is. WHY WOULD THAT BLACK GUY DO THAT TO HIMSELF? Am I supposed to imagine him saying to himself, <i>Nobody would ever believe that I&#x2019;m Goliath. I&#x2019;d better go by Black Goliath . . . because I have low superhero self-esteem.<br></i><br> It may not seem as ridiculous to you. But think about it with a more famous superhero.<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, Lex Luthor. Regular Superman isn&#x2019;t here. He sent Black Superman instead. We don&#x2019;t have to fight him. Just call the cops. They&#x2019;ll take care of him for us. They&#x2019;ll arrest him for loitering.&#x201d; And yes, there were Black superheroes who didn&#x2019;t have the word &#x201c;Black&#x201d; in their names&#x2014;Falcon, Cyborg, Power Man&#x2014;and there was even a Black Green Lantern who was just named Green Lantern, not Black Green Lantern or Dark Green Lantern . . . or even Pine Green Lantern. But that didn&#x2019;t seem better. Everybody knew that the <i>real </i>Green Lantern was (white) Hal Jordan. (Black) John Stewart (yes, the Black Green Lantern&#x2019;s name was John Stewart) was just holding the position until Hal showed back up ... which Hal always did. And Cyborg didn't really count because his <i>cyborg-ness </i>made it such that he didn't really have a secret identity anymore. He had half a robot face. Good luck convincing anybody that you're <i>not </i>a Cyborg with that going on.<br><br> "What do you mean, you think I'm Cyborg? You're being ridiculous,I don't look anythinglike Cyborg! ... Anyway, I gotta go change my eye battery and reboot my face's operating system."<br> And Falcon ... Sigh ... Falcon is one of those superheroes of many different races, including white, who just has the general feeling of a comic book writer saying to his boss, "WHAT? The new superhero is due tomorrow? Ummm ... No ... I totally have some� thing to show you! It's going to be great. I'm just going to get in my brand-new Ford Falcon and go home and get my brand� new superhero ... Wait a second! I GOT IT!" Heroes like Falcon&#x2014;whether they were meant to or not&#x2014;felt like they were designed to purposefully give the Black heroes shitty superpowers.<br> Falcon's big powers were that he had the powers of a falcon ... Also he could talk to falcons. Falcon was like Aquaman but much less impressive. At least Aquaman had a blue whale for backup. Falcon only had one bird hanging out with him. His powers are so ridiculous that when they put the character in the <i>Avengers </i>movie, they just gave him some robot wings and left the "falcon powers" behind. Rightfully so.<br><br> And Power Man started out as the superhero version of the star of a Blaxploitation film dressed like an extra from <i>The Pirates of Penzance. </i>He had blue pants, swashbuckler boots, a bright yellow puffy shirt, metal wristbands, and a weird metal headband. Eventually he gave all that nonsense up, and now he just wears regular clothes and goes by the much better name Luke Cage (exploding out of a Netflix box near you!).<br> So when I was a kid, as much as I paid <i>some </i>attention to these Black heroes, I rode hard with Spider-Man and the Hulk. All I had to do was picture my face under all that red and blue fabric of Spider-Man and under Hulk&#x2019;s green skin. It was easier than calling myself &#x201c;Black Batman&#x201d; or trying to get excited by a Black superhero with the powers of a gnat&#x2014;<i>Gnat-Man</i>! <i>Like Ant-Man, but even smaller!<br></i><br> And this is important. This is about representation. For some reason, white people in America are perfectly comfortable with the idea of people of color just contorting their imaginations such that we can imagine ourselves as white heroes, but white people generally aren&#x2019;t OK with imagining themselves as Black heroes. Every time there&#x2019;s talk of a new actor taking o...</p><h2>The Haunted House (Choose Your Own Adventure #2)</h2><p>An adventure story featuring a dog that disappears into an abandoned, possibly haunted, house.

MONTGOMERY attended Hopkins Grammar School, Williston-Northampton School and Williams College where he graduated in 1958. He pursued graduate studies in Religion and Economics at Yale and NYU. Montgomery was an adventurer all his life, climbing mountains in the Himalaya, skiing throughout Europe and scuba-diving wherever he could. His interested included education, macro-economics, geo-politics, mythology, history, mystery novels and music. He wrote his first interactive book, Journey Under the Sea, in 1976 and published it under the series name The Adventures of You. A few years later Bantam Books bought this book and gave Montgomery a contract for five more, to inaugurate their new children s publishing division. Bantam renamed the series Choose Your Own Adventure and a publishing phenomenon was born. The series has sold more than 260 million copies in over 40 languages. He was married to the writer Shannon Gilligan.

One of the most successful pop stars of the 80s, his face adorning posters on teenager&#39;s walls from Acton to Akron, Adam Ant was a phenomenon. Now in this frank and revealing autobiography, he tells the full story of his amazing life from his dysfunctional childhood to his key role in the punk movement and creation of a unique musical style that brought him a string of hits (both singles and albums). At one point he was so famous other stars sought his company and advice - even Michael Jackson called in the dead of night to ask about music and clothes. His many girlfriends included Jamie Lee Curtis and Heather Graham and for a time he lived in LA, acting in fifteen films. Adam also writes honestly about his life-long battle with manic depression. His first episodes were triggered by the stress of living with a violent, alcoholic father, and he tried to commit suicide when he was at art school. A gruelling episode with a stalker in LA precipitated a mental breakdown, and a stalker in London led to his well-publicised arrest and hospitalization in 2001. At times funny and at other times tragic, this is gripping account of the turbulent life and times of one of music&#39;s most fascinating figures.</p><p>Adam was born in north London and became in integral part of the capital&#39;s punk scene before creating his own brand of music. He had 13 hits in the top twenty (3 of them number ones), as well as bestselling albums. His music continues to be influential today.</p><h2>The Usborne First Thousand Words</h2><p>This is a revised edition of this vocabulary for young children and reluctant readers, and is designed to develop first reading and spelling skills.

She was an important factor in the reign of four kings, lived to the ripe old age of 82, bore 10 children and outlived all but two of them. Her sons were kings of England and her daughters queens of Castile and Sicily, while her later descendants included a Holy Roman emperor and kings of France and Spain, as well as a couple of saints. In an age of men, she was indeed a powerful woman.Born in 1122 into the sophisticated and cultured court of Poitiers, Eleanor of Aquitaine came of age in a world of luxury, bloody combat, and unbridled ambition. At only fifteen, she inherited one of the great fortunes of Europe - the prize duchy of Aquitaine - yet was forced to submit to a union with the handsome but sexually withholding Louis VII, the teenage king of France. The marriage endured for fifteen fraught years, until Eleanor finally succeeded in having it annulled - only to enter an even stormier match with Henry of Anjou, who would soon a</p><p>Combining the pace and descriptive quality of a novel with the authority of a textbook, Alison Weir's study of the revered and reviled Eleanor of Aquitaine should be valuable to anyone with an interest in medieval European history. Wife of Louis VII of France and subsequently of Henry II of England, and mother of Richard "the Lion-Hearted," Eleanor played a prominent part in the politics of the 12th century. The author of a number of other books on the medieval period (<i>Life of Elizabeth I</i>, <i>The Children of Henry VIII</i>), Weir brings all the color and ever-present dangers of Eleanor's world to life, filling the text with absorbing background detail and revelatory contemporary anecdotes. She is concerned throughout to make critical analysis of the primary sources, the later myths about Eleanor, and other modern biographies. This results in a fresh and thoughtful perspective on the energetic life of a determined and ambitious woman living with the sexism, excesses, and violence of a society in which the word of a single man could condemn thousands to death. <i>Eleanor of Aquitaine</i> is a vivacious but scholarly book with extensive notes and references, giving an objective and rich account of the staunch Eleanor, her feuding family and her complex and unstable world. <i>--Karen Tiley, Amazon.co.uk</i>Renowned in her time for being the most beautiful woman in Europe, the wife of two kings and mother of three, Eleanor of Aquitaine was one of the great heroines of the Middle Ages. At a time when women were regarded as little more than chattel, Eleanor managed to defy convention as she exercised power in the political sphere and crucial influence over her husbands and sons. In this beautifully written biography, Alison Weir paints a vibrant portrait of this truly exceptional woman, and provides new insights into her intimate world. Eleanor of Aquitaine lived a long life of many contrasts, of splendor and desolation, power and peril, and in this stunning narrative, Weir captures the woman-- and the queen--in all her glory. With astonishing historic detail, mesmerizing pageantry, and irresistible accounts of royal scandal and intrigue, she recreates not only a remarkable personality but a magnificent past era. <br></p><h2>Buried Child - Acting Edition (Acting Edition for Theater Productions)</h2><p>A newly revised edition of an American classic, Sam Shepard?s Pulitzer Prize?winning <i>Buried Child </i>is as fierce and unforgettable as it was when it was first produced more than twenty-five years ago.<br><br>A scene of madness greets Vince and his girlfriend as they arrive at the squalid farmhouse of Vince?s hard-drinking grandparents, who seem to have no idea who he is.

There, in a state-run hopsital, she and her new friend, Maureen, must learn to overcome the twin hardships of immigration and alienation, while they maintain the hope that they will be reunited with their families.</p><p>Reviewed with Kathryn Lasky's <i>Home at Last</i>.<p>Gr. 3-6. An Italian immigrant child writes her diary in these two small books that are part of the My America series. <i>Hope in My Heart</i> is the most dramatic. After the family finally arrives at Ellis Island, nine-year-old Sofia is separated from her parents and quarantined. Terrified, angry, and knowing almost no English, she is at the mercy of officials and doctors, some of whom are prejudiced and corrupt. Only her friendship with an Irish girl and the support of a kind official and a priest make her life bearable, until her heartfelt reunion with her family. <i>Home at Last</i> is a conventional account of Italian Americans who struggle and eventually make it in the North End community of Boston. A teacher makes a huge difference, as does a doctor, whose character is based on a real person, Lasky's husband's grandfather. As is often the case with books in this series, the diary format is an awkward contrivance, but it certainly makes the tale more immediate. A historical note and archival photos add to the story. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The audiobook's unnamed narrator, growing up during the 1950s, is beset by aloof parents, a cruel sister, and relentless mocking from his peers, compelling him to seek out works of art and literature as solace-and to uncover new relationships in the struggle to embrace his own sexuality. Lyrical and poignant, with powerful evocations of shame and yearning, this is an American literary treasure.</p></p><p>An instant classic upon its original publication, <b>A Boy's Own Story</b> is the first of Edmund White's highly acclaimed trilogy of autobiographical novels that brilliantly evoke a young man's coming of age and document American gay life through the last forty years. <br><br>The nameless narrator in this deeply affecting work reminisces about growing up in the 1950s with emotionally aloof, divorced parents, an unrelenting sister, and the schoolmates who taunt him. He finds consolation in literature and his fantastic imagination. Eager to cultivate intimate, enduring friendships, he becomes aware of his yearning to be loved by men, and struggles with the guilt and shame of accepting who he is. Written with lyrical delicacy and extraordinary power, <b>A Boy's Own Story</b> is a triumph."With <b>A Boy's Own Story</b> American literature is larger by one classic novel." --<i>The Washington Post Book World</i><br><br>"Every so often a novel comes along that is so ambitious in its intention and so confident of its voice that it reminds us what a singular and potent thing a novel can be.

One of the most influential political treatises of all time, The Communist Manifesto is essential reading for every student of politics and history.</p><p>"A spectre is haunting Europe," Karl Marx and Frederic Engels wrote in 1848, "the spectre of Communism." This new edition of <i>The Communist Manifesto</i>, commemorating the 150th anniversary of its publication, includes an introduction by renowned historian Eric Hobsbawm which reminds us of the document's continued relevance. Marx and Engels's critique of capitalism and its deleterious effect on all aspects of life, from the increasing rift between the classes to the destruction of the nuclear family, has proven remarkably prescient. Their spectre, manifested in the <i>Manifesto</i>'s vivid prose, continues to haunt the capitalist world, lingering as a ghostly apparition even after the collapse of those governments which claimed to be enacting its principles."A spectre is haunting Europe - the spectre of Communism." So begins one of history's most important documents, a work of such magnitude that it has forever changed not only the scope of world politics, but indeed the course of human civilization. The Communist Manifesto was written in Friedrich Engels's clear, striking prose and declared the earth-shaking ideas of Karl Marx. Upon publication in 1848, it quickly became the credo of the poor and oppressed who longed for a society "in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all." <br>The Communist Manifesto contains the seeds of Marx's more comprehensive philosophy, which continues to inspire influential economic, political, social, and literary theories. But the Manifesto is most valuable as an historical document, one that led to the greatest political upheaveals of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and to the establishment of the Communist governments that until recently ruled half the globe. <br>This Bantam Classic edition of The Communist Manifesto includes Marx and Engels's historic 1872 and 1882 prefaces, and Engels's notes and prefaces to the 1883 and 1888 editions.</p><h2>According to Humphrey: Winter According to Humphrey</h2><p>Winter According to Humphrey</p><p></p><h2>Grappling Master: Combat for Street Defense and Competition</h2><p>Gene Lebell was a grappling master who was sought out by Bruce Lee himself for his knowledge.

I was curled up with a book in a tent in a remote part of western Uganda. There are stupendously high and permanently snowcapped mountains there, the Ruwenzori&#x2014;the Mountains of the Moon, as they were called in ancient times&#x2014;and I was employed to look for copper in the canyons that led down from their peaks. I was a geologist with a brand-new Oxford University degree from my native England. Since I was looking forward to traveling the world, this job seemed a pretty good start. So there I was in Uganda, armed with a geologist&#x2019;s quartet of eternal best friends: a hammer, a magnifying glass, a compass, and a bottle of acid.</p><p><i>Except</i>. Yes, I loved geology. <i>But</i>&#x2014;and it was a <i>big</i> but&#x2014;I had long felt a burning urge to become a writer, too. Each time I climbed a mountain and gazed at the jungles below, I wanted to jot it all down and then have someone far away read about what a good time I was having.</p><p>On that fateful day in Uganda in the winter of 1966, I read a book from the local library called <i>Coronation Everest</i> by James Morris. It is about the first successful ascent of the world&#x2019;s highest mountain, Mount Everest in the Himalayas, by New Zealand&#x2019;s Sir Edmund Hillary and Nepal&#x2019;s Tenzing Norgay back in 1953.</p><p>The book&#x2019;s author was a special correspondent for the London <i>Times</i>. Though he had never climbed before, Morris managed to get himself some 25,000 feet (7,620 m) up the mountainside, and was perfectly placed for the moment when Hillary and Tenzing triumphantly reached the summit. Using all kinds of secret codes and cunning wiles Morris was the first to get the news back to London, in time to be published on the morning of the coronation of England&#x2019;s new queen, Elizabeth II. It was a royal gift and journalistic scoop of the highest order! Reading Morris&#x2019;s thrilling account and recognizing that this author&#x2019;s work seemed to allow him to travel the world, I decided, there and then, right in my little tent, that I wanted his job. I wanted to be him. I wanted to swap geology for journalism, and change the direction of my life in a profound way.</p><p>Headed for the Kamchatka Peninsula in far eastern Russia, home to twenty-nine active volcanoes.</p><p>I wrote to Morris, asking for advice. <i>If you think you can write,</i> he replied, <i>then do so. It is the best job imaginable. You&#x2019;ll never get rich, but you&#x2019;ll have a whale of a time. Give up being a geologist. Come back to England, right away, and see what you can do.</i></p><p>So I did as bidden. I went back to England and managed to get a reporter&#x2019;s job on a small-town newspaper where I found myself writing about science quite often, which seemed a good way of making use of my university education. I loved every minute of it. After two years or so on the local scene, I joined one of the big English national daily papers, <i>The Guardian</i>. And James Morris, who insisted on reading all of my early writings, proved an enthusiastic supporter. We became (and have remained) the best of friends, as my own career as a newspaper correspondent began slowly to take shape and then to take off.</p><p>Just in time for an eruption! Keeping an eye on the Zhupanovsky volcano.</p><p>For the next thirty years I wandered the world for <i>The Guardian</i> and other great newspapers. I was stationed in Ireland, America, Hong Kong, America again, India. I visited almost every country in the world. I covered wars and scandals, revolutions and assassinations. I interviewed presidents, kings, musicians, despots, geniuses, and film stars. I was put in prison for three months on spying charges in Argentina during the nasty little war over the British-claimed Falkland Islands. I learned to sail and traveled thousands of miles on small boats. I lived an unforgettable life, rootless and wandering and eternally content.</p><p>But then in 1998, I had an unexpected success with a book I wrote about the making of the famous<i> Oxford English Dictionary</i>. And soon afterward I decided, just as I had back in Africa thirty years before, that my life should take another profound change in direction. I would leave the world of daily journalism and try instead to make a living from the writing of books.</p><p></p></p><h2>Poland - A History</h2><p>Hard to find</p><p><b>Adam Zamoyski</b> was born in New York and has spent much of his life in England, where he was educated at Oxford.

Beginning with explanations of Sun signs, Moon signs, Ascendent, Midheaven, planets and their positions in various houses, this book leads on to show how to make a personal chart in easy-to-follow, step-by-step sequences. The encyclopaedia is aimed at novice and experienced astrologers alike.</p><p>With its lavish color illustrations, detailed discussions of astrological techniques, and comprehensive chart building tools, <i>Parkers' Astrology</i> is an outstanding book for any serious student of astrology. The husband and wife team of Julia and Derek Parker reissued this edition that offers many new components, such as the recently discovered comet/asteroid Chiron and its eccentric orbit. (For example, when Chiron is in Aries, the typical Arian could experience considerable restlessness.) It also includes new discussions on eclipses, Relocation Astrology, and Horary Astrology (which focuses on where and when a question is asked, rather than a birth chart). The first half offers rich color graphics and compelling narratives about the 12 sun signs, various chart reading techniques, and how astrology influences sexuality, health, business, and family. The second half delves into the nitty-gritty work of astrology and is downscaled to three-color visuals. It includes a hefty 150- page section on "The Planets at Work" and a 75-page section on astrological tables. The 1994 edition was faulted for being too difficult to build a chart from. Hopefully, astrologers will find this revised edition more accessible and consistent. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>Julia and Derek Parker are a best-selling husband and wife team who have produced over 50 books, including the internationally acclaimed The Complete Astrologer and The Complete Book of Dreams.

In <b>Party of the People</b>, veteran political chronicler Jules Witcover traces the Democratic Party&#x2019;s evolution, from its roots in the agrarian, individualistic concepts of Thomas Jefferson to its emergence as today&#x2019;s progressive party of social change and economic justice. Witcover describes the Democrats' dramatic struggle to de�ne themselves and shares with us half a century of personal observation of the party through its most turbulent times.<br><br>First called, oddly enough, the Republican Party but later known as the Democratic-Republican Party and eventually the Democratic Party, this creature of Jefferson and James Madison evolved from an early ideological and personal struggle with the commerce-minded Alexander Hamilton. Seasoned by the populism of Andrew Jackson, the party was nearly undone by the &#x201c;peculiar institution&#x201d; of slavery in the South, which led to the birth of the rival Republican Party and to the Civil War. Half a century later, America emerged from World War I under Democrat Woodrow Wilson as a reluctant international player, and from World War II under Franklin Roosevelt as a liberal bastion and global superpower. <br>In the civil rights revolution, the party shed much of its racist past, but subsequent white middle-class resentments and the divisive Vietnam War opened the door to a rival conservatism that effectively demon-ized Democratic liberalism. Defensively, the party under Bill Clinton sought safer centrist ground and seemed on the brink of establishing a &#x201c;third way," until the disastrous 2000 electoral college defeat of Al Gore left the Democrats shaken and splintered. As the new century emerges, they are debating whether to return to their liberal roots, setting themselves clearly apart from the Republicans, or press on with the centrist pursuit of a broader, less liberal constituency. <br><br>In <b>Party of the People</b> (a perfect companion to <b>Grand Old Party </b>by Lewis L. Gould, a history of the Republicans published simultaneously by Random House), Jules Witcover offers a rich and comprehensive popular history of the ideas, struggles, and key �gures that have de�ned the Democratic Party over the past two hundred years and are now</p><p>Given the Democratic Party's fundamental role in shaping the United States, a history of the Democrats, "the world's oldest existing party," demands a virtual history of American government. In Jules Witcover's massive <i>Party of the People: A History of the Democrats</i> he attempts to capture the party's long evolution in a single volume. Though Witcover is sometimes burdened by the need to condense complex political events into textbook summaries, the book is authoritative and often useful as a first resource for political history.<p> From the start, Witcover draws from "the two disciplines of contemplative history and contemporary or &#x2018;instant' history" to varying degrees of success. <i>Party of the People</i> is best when "instant" history holds sway, most notably in discussions of the Clinton and Gore presidential runs, where Witcover includes snippets of controversial speeches and press conferences. Earlier chapters, however, neglect primary source material under the pressure to summarize. Witcover's coverage of Andrew Jackson, for example, lacks direct citations that would bolster "Old Hickory's" reputation as a charismatic figure. While comprehensive at the federal executive level, the book is uneven in its treatment of the other levels and branches of government. Also, Witcover tends to underplay the role of slavery in the early history of the Democrats, especially in his explanations of Jefferson's "agrarian" virtue.</p><p> The book ends just as President George W. Bush has launched the war in Iraq and the Democratic candidates are lining up for the 2004 election. Looking ahead, Witcover sees the Democratic Party in a period of "identity crisis and dilemma." But, despite the contentious atmosphere between the liberal Campaign for America's Future and the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, he finds a common thread that connects modern Democrats to their founder, Thomas Jefferson: the "commitment to social and economic justice." While not perfect, <i>Party of the People</i>'s treatment of the Democratic Party's quest for justice offers a valuable reference for students and educators. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>&#x201c;<i>Party of the People </i>is a fine popular history of the world&#x2019;s oldest political party written by an astute veteran observer of American politics.&#x201d; <br>-<b>Arthur M.

In addition to <i>The View from Rat Lake</i> and <i>Trout Burn,</i> he is the author of <i>Fishing the High Country.</i> He lives on the St. Vrain River in Colorado.<p> <b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> <b>Sex, Death, and Fly-fishing</b> </p><p> On a stretch of one of the forks of a small river near where I live in northern Colorado, there is, in the month of July, a fabulous Red Quill spinner fall. As near as I can tell, it consists of at least three different species of these reddish-brown mayflies ranging in size from number 12s down to 16s or 18s. The fall lasts for weeks -- sometimes more than a month -- on and off, coming and going, overlapping, hardly ever the same twice. </p><p> No, I don't know which specific bugs are involved and, at the risk of insulting the entomologists, I'm not sure how much it would matter if I did. When the fall comes off, you fish one of the Red Quill or Rusty Spinner patterns in the appropriate size. When it doesn't come off, knowing the Latin name of the insect that is mysteriously absent lets you piss and moan in a dead language, but otherwise doesn't help much. </p><p> And there are plenty of evenings when this thing doesn't work out from a fishing standpoint, even though the bugs are at least in evidence on an almost nightly basis. As spinner falls go, this is the spookiest one I've seen, probably only because I've seen so much of it. Usually it has to do with the weather. </p><p> Here on the East Slope of the Rocky Mountains midsummer is the season for hot, clear, bluebird days punctuated by late afternoon thundershowers. Mayfly spinners -- most of them, anyway -- like to fall in the evenings when the light is low, and the air is cool and maybe a little damp. That's <i>a little</i> damp; a full-fledged rain can put them off, depending on the timing. </p><p> If the rain comes early enough in the day, it's over before the spinner fall should happen, and it has actually helped things along by chilling and humidifying the air a little. It's part of the local lore that an early shower can mean a good spinner fall later on. </p><p> If a thunderstorm comes late enough, after the flies have already formed up over the stream -- and suddenly enough, without announcing itself with too much wind or cool air -- it can flush the bugs into the water where the trout can get them. </p><p> This can make for some great fishing, provided the rain is heavy enough to knock the flies down, but not so heavy it makes the water too rough for the trout to see them -- in which case the fish won't feed on them after all. </p><p> When that happens, you race downstream in your rain slicker to where the current pools out at the head of a small canyon reservoir in hopes that when the storm passes, the bugs will be collected down there and the trout will rise to them. </p><p> That's assuming the rain doesn't last too long, and doesn't muddy the water so much that the trout, once again, can't see the bugs on the surface of the stream, and, once again, won't eat them. </p><p> When the rain comes at its more normal time -- a few hours before dusk, before the spinner fall should start -- it may cool the air in the canyon <i>too much,</i> and cancel the event, although you might just hike up there anyway because some nights the weather clears off, warms up just enough (but not too much), gets very still, and the spinner fall is unusually heavy. </p><p> Sometimes. </p><p> Not always. </p><p> And I am not being sarcastic when I say that trout are known to be particularly fond of spinners. </p><p> On rare overcast, drizzly afternoons, the Red Quill dun hatch can last late, and the spinner fall can come early, giving you hours of good fishing with a transition point when both forms of the bug are on the water at once. Many trout can be caught on dry flies then if you're smart enough to notice what's happening with the weather, drop everything at home, and get up there early. Under gray skies and drizzle, dusk is usually too late. </p><p> Wet, gloomy summer days are unusual in semiarid Colorado, and this has only happened three times that I know of in something like ten years. I missed it once, although I sure heard about it later from some friends who were there. They caught lots of trout, including some big ones. It was great, they said, in a not so subtle tone of accusation. </p><p> The assumption out here is, you should always go fishing, period. If you don't, even for what might appear in other circles to be a good reason, the suspicion is that you are getting uppity or, even worse, lazy. You get some grief for staying home, and when the fishing was great, well... </p><p> People will forgive you for missing it once or twice, but no more than that. </p><p> On other days when I <i>was</i> there and ready, the air got too cool, or a stiff breeze came up, or the drizzle got too drizzly, or something. Once it was looking just right until a sheet of hail drew itself across the canyon like a gauze curtain, and my friend Koke Winter and I ended up huddling in the flimsy cover of a juniper tree getting whacked hard by a few less hailstones than if we'd been standing out in the open. A big one got me square on the back of the hand when I reached out to pick a nearly ripe raspberry. By morning I had a bruise the size of a quarter. </p><p> It was all over in about twenty minutes, and the evening slid into ideal, textbook conditions -- cool, still, dusky, humid -- except that not a single swallow flashed in the air over the stream to eat the bugs because there were no flies, and not a single trout rose for the same reason. The sky was clear with stars, the air was freshly washed and thick with clean, organic smells, the reservoir was a dark, disk-shaped mirror. To anyone but a fly-fisherman it would have seemed peaceful and quite pretty. </p><p> We figured the hail had killed all the flies and knocked all the trout senseless, so we went home. Koke doesn't drink anymore, so we couldn't even stop for a beer. </p><p> For the absolutely cosmic spinner fall, it seems as though perfect conditions have to also be <i>preceded</i> by perfect conditions, and I don't know how far back in time this meteorological juggling act has to go. I do know that even a slightly larger dose of what would normally be ideal is deadly. I suppose there's a lesson there. </p><p> It seems like your best bet for a workmanlike, day-to-day spinner fall is a clear, warm evening with no wind. This kind of conservative weather stops short of being the model of perfection, but it doesn't court disaster either. </p><p> The more you fish the more you start seeing these things the way a farmer does: it doesn't have to be great, just, please, don't let it be awful. </p><p> On those days you hike up the stream with the last direct rays of sunlight still on the water. This is a shallow, stooped-shouldered, forested canyon with a few rock outcrops at the water, and a few more standing up at the lip. The slope is gentle enough lower down to allow for some patches of wild grass. The stream has a sand and sandstone bottom, so even when it's clear it can seem to have a brownish cast to it. Some evenings it gets amber for a few seconds just before the light goes off it. </p><p> A good hundred yards downstream from the riffle we always start at, you can see the swarm of mayflies high in the air above the stream, dipping and climbing, their clear wings flashing. At these times they look like they're spinning, hence the name. </p><p> These particular mayflies seem to begin mating about the time the light goes off them. It's not a deep canyon, and it runs roughly east and west, so the sun stays on the water longer than you'd think it should. Not that you're likely to be impatient or anything. The bugs copulate on the wing, and then begin to fall on the water right around dark. </p><p> Sometimes, as the insects dip lower and lower over the stream, the odd, eager brown trout will jump out of the water and try to grab one. He seldom gets it. Nine times out of ten this is a little fish and you ignore it, but when it's a big trout you tie on an upright-winged Red Quill and cast it over there. </p><p> He almost never takes it. I know this to be true, but I have yet to figure out why. It should work but it doesn't, that's all. </p><p> Usually the few trout you see rising sporadically here and there while the spinners are still in the air will be taking ants, beetles, the occasional midge, errant mayfly dun, or caddis fly. Whatever happens to be around, in other words. This is not an especially rich stream, so the fish have learned to eat whatever is there. </p><p> On many nights the real spinner fall, and, therefore, the real hot fishing, begins after dark when you can't see what you're doing. You stumble over rocks, wade too deeply and ship water, snag your fly in the bushes, and tie wind knots in your leader that you don't know about until you hear them whistle past your ear. The question then is whether it will be easier to retie the leader or untie the knot, keeping in mind that you can't see what the hell you're doing in either case. </p><p> When you do get a good cast on the water, hints as to where your fly is and whether or not a trout has eaten it are sometimes telegraphed back to you in terms of spreading, starlit ripples and/or soft plopping sounds. But they're just hints. You can fish for hours without knowing for sure if you're using the wrongsized fly, getting a bad drift, or if you're getting strikes you don't know about. </p><p> There are a few of us who fish this thing regularly, even though the trout aren't normally very big, and even though we often don't catch very many of them. The fact is, we seem to be truly fascinated by it, and I say that based on the evidence. </p><p> When we go up there and the spinners aren't happening for some reason, we don't tie on streamers or fish ants to the bank feeders because that might trash the water if the spinners actually do come on later. Nor do we work upstream to fish the pocket water with caddis flies because the spinners might come on while we're gone. We do a lot of standing around with spinner patterns already tied to 5 or 6x tippets, fly rods under our arms, hands in pockets, waiting. Sometimes there's a big beaver to watch, or little brown myotis bats to dodge. It can be nice and peaceful. </p><p> I like to think of this spinner fall as one of the great enigmas: the kind of thing that puts all the how-to-do-it fly-fishing writing in its place. If you hit it just right, the problem is not "How to Catch Trout During a Spinner Fall" -- that's something you'll do without much trouble at all -- but hitting it right is a matter of exquisite timing and some luck. It's the kind of puzzle where the challenge isn't to put the pieces together, but just to locate all the damned pieces in the first place. </p><p> We sometimes catch ourselves getting a little conceited as we stand out there in the dark without having landed so much as a single trout between us all evening. I mean, this is the really <i>difficult</i> fishing, definitely not for amateurs. </p><p> Someone finally says, "I'll tell ya, this isn't something for those guys who have to have 'big fish and lots of 'em,' is it?" </p><p> And someone else answers, trying to keep the uncertainty out of his voice, "Nope, it sure isn't." </p><p> For the moment at least, we fall into that class of fishermen who fancy themselves to be poet/philosophers, and from that vantage point we manage to pull off one of the neatest tricks in all of sport: the fewer fish we catch the more superior we feel. </p><p> Part of the fascination has to do with the mayflies themselves. We fly-fishers have a historic and abiding affection for them, and it's no wonder. </p><p> First there's that seemingly magical transformation. The insects spend most of their lives as downright unattractive bugs living under rocks on the stream bottom, but then, one day when all the signals are green, they swim to the surface to emerge as these really pretty flies. Even people who aren't especially interested in bugs will admit that mayflies are quite beautiful, at least after you've explained that they're not some kind of mosquito. </p><p> Beauty from ugliness, the sudden freedom of flight after a lifetime under a rock, and all that. It really is something. </p><p> These are the mayfly duns, and, as we all know, the ones that aren't eaten up by trout or birds fly to bankside bushes where they soon molt into spinners. </p><p> As pretty as the duns are, the spinners are even prettier. Their tails get longer and more graceful, their body colors brighten, and their wings get clear and sparkly. They're lovely, and this seems appropriate to us, because now the bugs' only chores in life are to mate and expire. Scientists call the whole group of mayflies Ephemeridae, from the same Latin that gave us "ephemeral," or "lasting for a brief time; short-lived; transitory." Even "tragic" if you want to stretch it. </p><p> We seem to have a real affection for the image of a beautiful insect that only lives for a single day (more or less) and whose only mission is to make love just once. They don't even eat. Poets got off on this as symbolic of the fleeting nature of life, love, and beauty until it became a clich� and had to be dropped or turned into a joke. The last literary reference I saw to it was in an old <i>Playboy</i> cartoon that showed a boy mayfly saying to a girl mayfly, "What do you mean, <i>'not tonight'!?"</i> </p><p> Mayflies and fly-fishing have always been inseparably connected (they're our favorite bug, after all), and that may be one reason why the sport is still seen as contemplative, even now with all our scientific and technical hoopla. </p><p> This really is kind of sweet, in a nineteenth-century sort of way, and it's not too difficult to attach religious overtones to it as well, but it's also efficient as all get out in a biological sense. Technically, this behavior is called semelparity, and it is described best by David Quammen in his wonderful book <i>Natural Acts:</i> "An animal or plant waits a very long time to breed only once, does so with suicidal strenuosity, and then promptly dies. The act of sexual procreation proves to be ecstatically fatal, fatally ecstatic. And the rest of us are left merely to say: Wow." </p><p> Quammen points out that bamboo trees (from which fly rods are made) do it this way, and that salmon (on which fly rods are used) do it this way, too. I think that's interesting. Could there be some wild, metaphysical connection that makes fly-fishing incredibly sexy? </p><p> I sincerely hope so. </p><p> Mayflies mate and die en masse (it's been referred to as an orgy, but never as a mass suicide) probably at least partly for the same reason that large numbers of them hatch all at once: because hungry trout eat great numbers of them at these times and, with lots of the bugs making a break for it at once, some will get away to finish the business. It's a kind of suicidal diversionary tactic, and it works just fine in a system where the individual doesn't count for much. </p><p> The spinners mate and lay their eggs a little upstream from where the duns hatched, usually over a riffle, thus ensuring that the new eggs, as they wash downstream, will land on the bottom more or less in the same place the last batch did. If they hadn't always leapfrogged upstream like this; that is, if they'd mated and laid their eggs each season where they'd just hatched, they'd have slid downstream a few yards each year, and by now they'd have washed out to sea and become extinct. </p><p>...</p></p><h2>The Jews in the Roman World</h2><p>Clean tight copy is gently read.

She's been though it, and speaks and writes eloquently about feelings and fantasies surrounding suicide. </p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Outfoxed</h2><p>From the bestselling author of the landmark work Rubyfruit Jungle comes an engaging, original new novel that only Rita Mae Brown could have written. In the pristine world of Virginia foxhunting, hunters, horses, hounds, and foxes form a lively community of conflicting loyalties, where the thrill of the chase and the intricacies of human-animal relationships are experienced firsthand--and murder exposes a proud Southern community's unsavory secrets. . . . <br><br>As Master of the prestigious Jefferson Hunt Club, Jane Arnold, known as Sister, is the most revered citizen in the Virginia Blue Ridge Mountain town where a rigid code of social conduct and deep-seated tradition carry more weight than money. Nearing seventy, Sister now must select a joint master to ensure a smooth transition of leadership after her death. It is an honor of the highest order--and one that any serious social climber would covet like the Holy Grail.<br><br>Virginian to the bone with a solid foxhunting history, Fontaine Buruss is an obvious candidate, but his penchant for philandering and squandering money has earned him a less than sparkling reputation. And not even Sister knows about his latest tawdry scandal. Then there is Crawford Howard, a Yankee in a small town where Rebel bloodlines are sacred. Still, Crawford has money--lots of it--and as Sister is well aware, maintaining a first-class hunt club is far from cheap. <br><br>With the competition flaring up, Southern gentility flies out the window. Fontaine and Crawford will stop at nothing to discredit each other. Soon the entire town is pulled into a rivalry that is spiraling dangerously out of control. Even the animals have strong opinions, and only Sister is able to maintain objectivity. But when opening hunt day ends in murder, she, too, is stunned. <br><br>Who was bold and skilled enough to commit murder on the field? It could only be someone who knew both the territory and the complex nature of the hunt inside out. Sister knows of three people who qualify--and only she, with the help of a few clever foxes and hounds, can lay the trap to catch the killer.<br><br>A colorful foray into an intriguing world, Outfoxed features a captivating cast of Southerners and their unforgettable animal counterparts. Rita Mae Brown has written a masterful novel that surprises, delights, and enchants.</p><p>Rita Mae Brown fervently believes that felines are a lot smarter than most people, and in her popular Mrs. Murphy mysteries, the cats are always leaps and bounds ahead of their human companions. (They also speak in italics, which makes it easy to distinguish them from their somewhat bumbling owner/companions.) In <i>Outfoxed</i> the foxes, hounds, and a few clever birds solve a murder that's hardly more than a raison d'�tre for Brown's thorough and detailed description of the highly ritualized world of the Jefferson Hunt. Fox hunting is more than just an entertaining way to spend a fall afternoon in Virginia--it's a way of life for everyone involved, from Sister Jane, the Master of the Fox Hunt, to Crawford Howard and Fontaine Buruss, two men who'd kill for the chance to succeed her. By the time a death actually occurs, Brown is three-fourths of the way to the last page, but it doesn't really matter; by this point, the reader is wholly involved in the arcane world of casts, whippers, scent stations, ratshots, and the social rules of the canid and canine communities. And while a man has been murdered, it's the slaughter of the fox used to lure him to his death that really upsets Sister, the strong-willed matriarch who is the novel's protagonist. The thrill of the chase--the hunt itself, not the search for the killer--is on every page of this masterful foray into a fascinating world. And as usual in a Rita Mae Brown novel, the animals have the best lines as well as the last word. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Rita Mae Brown is the bestselling author of Rubyfruit Jungle, In Her Day, Six of One, Southern Discomfort, Sudden Death, High Hearts, Bingo, Starting from Scratch: A Different Kind of Writer's Manual, Venus Envy, Dolley: A Novel of Dolley Madison in Love and War, Riding Shotgun, Loose Lips, and a memoir, Rita Will.

Until you know the people who disappear. Too much coincidence, you look for reason. Too much death, you grasp for something to blame. Carson pulled Delaney out and he died on the side of the road with her mouth pressed to his. Her air in his body. Troy. She told the cops it was suicide. Didn't matter. The lake released her and grabbed another. But when Decker's father dies in a pool of spilled water on their kitchen floor, all Decker can feel is a slow burning rage. Because he knows that Delaney knew that his dad was going to die. She knew and backed out of his house and never said a word. Falcon Lake still has a hold on them both, and Decker can't forgive Delaney until he knows why.</p><p><p><b>MEGAN MIRANDA</b> is the author of <i>Fracture</i> and <i>Hysteria</i>.

What's worse, scores of closed-minded music critics dismissed the music out of hand simply because of the antics of these so-called fans. Author Blair Jackson sets out on a commendable mission to bring Jerry Garcia <i>the musician</i> into clear focus. Tapping his experience as both a devout Deadhead and a veteran journalist, Jackson's mission is a roaring success. He painstakingly details every musical turn that the Dead took and discusses every side project Garcia embarked on--from the endless stream of bluegrass, old-time, and jug bands of the early 1960s through collaborations both famous and obscure. (Even dedicated fans may not know of Garcia's futile attempt at joining Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys.) Garcia emerges as a talented, versatile, and obsessive musician with a voracious appetite for all forms of music--as long as it came from the heart. <p> In the process of documenting his musical career, Jackson also presents a picture of Garcia's fascinating offstage life, including the events and inspiration that translated into songs and solos. The author conducted scores of interviews with Garcia himself and with anyone else who could provide insight into Garcia's personality. While never glossing over the unseemly aspects of Garcia's life, Jackson doesn't dwell on them either. In fact, he openly offers connections between Garcia's drug use and his music when they prove appropriate. Neophytes may be turned off by the constant detailed references to specific songs and shows--even particular sound effects--but for the avid follower, Jackson's comprehensive book is a wonderful celebration of an underrated and misunderstood musician. <i>--Marc Greilsamer</i></p>An unparalleled portrait of Jerry Garcia -- the musical genius, the brilliant songwriter, and ultimately, the tortured soul plagued by his own addiction<p>He was there when Dylan went electric, when a generation danced naked at Woodstock, and when Ken Kesey started experimenting with acid. He was one of the most gifted musicians of all times, and he was a member of one of the most worshiped rock 'n' roll bands in history. Now, veteran rock journalist Blair Jackson has stitched together Garcia's story from more than a hundred of his own interviews with Garcia and his friends, lovers, and bandmates, and from thousands of pages of source material from the '50s through the '90s.</p><p>With more than forty photographs, many of them previously unpublished, Garcia: An American Life is the ultimate tribute to the man who, as Bob Dylan said, "had no equal".</p></p><h2>Inspired to Design: Seven Steps to Successful Art Quilts</h2><p>Awaken your inner artist with this hands-on, exciting exercise guide that takes you through the seven-step process to design successful art quilts.

(<i>mixed-media-artist.com, June 11, 2013</i>)<br><br>Elizabeth grew up in York, England, which is described in the information about the author as a dark Northern city, a statement most of us Northerners would take exception to! However, the interaction of light and time on buildings influenced her first quilts and the contrast between dark and light continues to influence and inspire her. The book is divided into seven instructional steps with hands-on exercises to guide you step-by-step through the process of designing an art quilt. It includes in-depth sections on composing a design, working with colour and value, and is suitable for art quilters of all levels.

Most of Elizabeth's work is quite colorful, but she walks you through values and color charts to show how you could change the mood or feel of a project with a few color changes. The elimination of some objects from a photo inspiration doesn't seem to really change the overall impact of the design in many cases&#x2014;a valuable lesson to this reviewer. The author makes quilting suggestions to continue the intention of your original design, including why and when to use metallic threads and/or the style of fill to use. (<i>On Track!

She is the author or coauthor of nine books, including <i>The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Parents Are Going Broke.</i> Elizabeth served as Chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and is Massachusetts&#x2019;s first female senator. She lives with her husband in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<i>Getting Started: The Truth About Money</i> <p> The rules of the game have changed. </p><p> Somewhere in your bones, you already know this. Hard work and good intentions are no longer enough. Security, comfort, lasting prosperity -- you want it, you work hard for it, and yet the worry remains. Real financial peace seems so hard to achieve. </p><p> You can't count on good old-fashioned hard work the way your parents did. Go to school, get a good job, do your work, don't go crazy with spending, and everything will work out, right? Not anymore. That advice may have worked in your parents' day, but today you have to be <i>smart</i> with your money. Not just a little smart, but super smart. You have to learn the new rules -- the rules nobody told you and nobody talks about. And you have to learn them fast. </p><p> Just for a moment, forget what you know about money. Forget about your bills. Forget the size of your paycheck. Forget your shopping trips and the shoes you just bought. We want to give you a new perspective on your money, a different way to think about it. We want you to explore new possibilities. </p><p> What if we told you that this book could show you how to cover your bills, without worry or fear? No more bounced checks. No more anxiety about how you'll make it through the month. Just the power to pay your bills on time, and then to relax in security and comfort. </p><p> Now, what if we told you that on top of showing you how to conquer your bills, this book could show you how to have some money for fun? No living like a Scrooge. No asking yourself every minute, <i>"Can I really afford this?"</i> Just some cash in your pocket for plain old just-because-you-feel-like-it <i>fun.</i> </p><p> And now, suppose we told you that in addition to all of this, you could still have money to save? Money to get <i>ahead,</i> each and every month. Enough money so that you could finally start to dream a little -- and make real progress toward those dreams. Enough to build some <i>real</i> wealth. </p><p> And what if we said you could do all this without counting pennies, without carrying around a calculator, and without thinking constantly about money? In fact, after a little up-front work, you could stop thinking about money altogether, and spend your days focusing on the things that really matter. </p><p> Would you keep reading? </p><p> </p><b>Is This Book for You?</b> <p> At this point, you may be thinking, "Aw c'mon. I've looked at these financial books before. All windup and no delivery. They take your $26 and leave you no better off." All those get-rich-quick schemes that assume you have thousands of dollars lying around, just waiting for the right investment. All those chapters on how to buy stock options, how to choose a vacation home, how to plan your estate so that your kids can inherit millions without paying taxes. Who are they kidding? </p><p> Or maybe you bought one of those "Billionaire Tells All" books, which promised to unlock all the secrets to becoming fabulously wealthy. And here you are, still trying to figure out how the heck you're supposed to "make your money work for you." </p><p> And then there are the lectures on what <i>they</i> think your problem is. <i>"Stop taking expensive vacations." "Shift to a better mutual fund."</i> But what if you haven't taken a real vacation in ages? What if you don't have two nickels for a mutual fund, or maybe you aren't quite sure what a mutual fund is? </p><p> We'll let you in on a secret: <i>Those books are not written for you.</i> They are written for people who already have plenty of money, people who don't worry about making ends meet. Oh sure, the store is glad to take your money, but those books are written for people who are already rich and who want to get just a little bit richer. So, where is <i>your</i> book? </p><p> Right here. <i>All Your Worth</i> is for anyone who ever worries about money. For anyone who works hard and plays by the rules, but discovers that the rules have changed. For anyone who wants to build wealth, but isn't sure how to get started. In short, this book is for anyone who wants to get control of his or her money once and for all, to stop worrying and start living a richer, fuller life. </p><p> </p>This book is for anyone who wants control of his or her money, once and for all. <p> If you have already solved all your money problems, if you are secure about your future and never worry about money, if all you want is a book to help you get a little richer, then keep shopping. This isn't your book. But if you are like the rest of us, and if you are ready to take charge of your money, then this is your chance to make some profound changes in your life. </p><p> </p><b>Building Your Worth Over a Lifetime -- A Plan That Works</b> <p> We want to be clear right from the start: We are not going to tell you how to get rich working ten minutes a day. We are not going to claim that you can live like a millionaire on $20,000 a year. And we are not going to pretend that you can retire at age 32. We figure you are too smart to believe that kind of twaddle anyway. </p><p> We are also not going to say that if you'll just shift to generic toilet paper and put $5 a week in the bank, all your problems will instantly disappear. A few pennies here and a few pennies there, and the next thing you know, you will be debt-free, investment-rich, and lighting cigars with Donald Trump. Nope, we're not selling that brand of snake oil. </p><p> In fact, you won't get any count-your-pennies advice here. And for a very good reason: Penny-counting advice is downright dangerous. That's right--<i>dangerous.</i> Trying to count every penny won't solve your financial problems. But it <i>will</i> distract you from the real issues. (It will also provide you with lots of opportunities to fight with your loved ones and make everyone miserable!) This book skips the pennies and goes straight to the heart of the matter -- getting real control over your dollars. </p><p> Here's a little secret that the other financial books won't tell you: Savvy money managers don't spend a lot of time looking for ways to save a few pennies. They charge right ahead to the big-ticket items, looking to make high-impact changes in the shortest period of time. They don't sweat the small stuff. And neither will we. </p><p> </p>Savvy money Managers start with the dollars, not the pennies. <p> We're going to work on the big stuff, not the pennies. This means that what we're going to do is completely different from those other books. But we'll do it anyway. Why? Because it <i>works.</i> It will take some effort at first, but once you get going, you can manage your bills <i>and</i> start some serious wealth creation. </p><p> How can we be so sure this will work? Because <i>All Your Worth</i> isn't based on gut reasoning or lucky guesses. It is based on more than twenty years of intensive research, drawing on the experiences of literally thousands of people from across the country. </p><p> This book doesn't waste time lecturing you on problems someone dreamed up. It focuses on the <i>real</i> issues that regular people struggle with every day. And it offers workable, lifetime solutions designed to help ordinary people get control over their money once and for all. </p><p> </p><i>All Your Worth</i> is based on more than twenty years of intensive research. <p> </p><b>The Origins of <i>All Your Worth</i></b> <p> One of us (Elizabeth) is a professor at Harvard Law School. I have spent decades writing academic books and teaching an entire generation of law students about the rules of money. I have gone before the United States Supreme Court, the White House, and Congress to talk about those rules. I have raised so much noise on television, on radio, and in the newspapers about financial trouble in America that I was named one of the Fifty Most Influential Women Lawyers in America. But I have spent a lot of my time out of the spotlight, giving advice to people -- friends, family, folks who participated in our various studies. These "What can you do right here, right now" conversations have become a big part of my life. </p><p> The other of us (Amelia) is a financial consultant, with an MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. I started my career as a consultant with McKinsey &amp; Company, where I advised some of the largest corporations in America. Then I left the big-business world to cofound HealthAllies, a new kind of company dedicated to helping families get more affordable health care. Today I spend my time writing or speaking on the radio about finance, and working with people who want to get control of their money. </p><p> We are also mother and daughter, two women who come from a long line of hardscrabble Okies. Shortly before I (Elizabeth) was born, my father lost the family's life savings to a crooked business partner. During my growing-up years, Daddy sold carpeting at a department store and worked as a maintenance man for an apartment complex. I got my first job at 9, rocking a neighbor's colicky baby in the afternoons so his mama could get a few hours of sleep. By age 11 I was taking in sewing, and at 16 I worked the mail desk at an insurance office. My college financial aid applications classified my family as "poor," although I never thought we were any worse off than our neighbors. </p><p> I was married at 19, and Amelia was born three years later. She spent her early years tagging along while I went back to school. We lived on a budget that was so tight that I still remember crying with relief when my mother-in-law offered me one of her dresses to wear to a job interview. (She was seven inches shorter than I am, so you can imagine how ungainly I looked!) </p><p> I (Amelia) spent a lot of my childhood in a moving van, as my mom moved from place to place, finishing law school and then taking teaching jobs at various colleges. First New Jersey, then Texas, then Michigan, then Pennsylvania, and finally off to Massachusetts.

The dragon keepers and the fledgling dragons are forging a passage up the treacherous Rain Wild River. They are in search of the mythical Elderling city of Kelsingra, and are accompanied by the liveship Tarman, its captain, Leftrin, and a group of hunters who must search the forests for game with which to keep the dragons fed. With them are Alise, who has escaped her cold marriage to the cruel libertine Hest Finbok in order to continue her study of dragons, and Hest&#39;s amanuensis, Bingtown dandy, Sedric. Rivalries and romances are already threatening to disrupt the band of explorers: but external forces may prove to be even more dangerous. Chalcedean merchants are keen to lay hands on dragon blood and organs to turn them to medicines and profit. Their traitor has infiltrated the expeditionand will stop at nothing to obtain the coveted body parts. And then there are the Rain Wilds themselves: mysterious, unstable and ever perilous, its mighty river running with acid, its jungle impenetrable and its waterways uncharted. Will the expedition reach their destination unscathed? Does the city of Kelsingra even exist? Only one thing is certain: the journey will leave none of the dragons nor their human companions unchanged by the experience.</p><p><p>Fifteen dragons have set off on a dangerous trek up the Rain Wild River, in hopes of rediscovering their lost haven, the ancient city of Kelsingra. Accompanying them is a disparate group of rejects from Rain Wild society, including strong and defiant young Thymara; wealthy dragon scholar and Trader's wife Alise; and her companion, the urbane Sedric. These human keepers yearn also to create a new home where they can decide their own fate. But is Kelsingra real or merely a fragment of a glorified past buried deep in the dragons' shared memories?</p><p>As they forge ever deeper into uncharted wilderness, starvation, flashfloods, and predators imperil them all.

As a writer who finds inspiration with Hemingway in Paris and Virginia Woolf in London, as a spy recruited by Ian Fleming and betrayed in the war and as an art-dealer in &#39;60s New York, Logan mixes with the movers and shakers of his times. But as a son, friend, lover and husband, he makes the same mistakes we all do in our search for happiness. Here, then, is the story of a life lived to the full - and a journey deep into a very human heart.</p><p>Logan Gonzago Mountstuart, writer, was born in 1906, and died of a heart attack on October 5, 1991, aged 85. William Boyd's novel <i>Any Human Heart</i> is his disjointed autobiography, a massive tome chronicling "my personal rollercoaster"--or rather, "not so much a rollercoaster", but a yo-yo, "a jerking spinning toy in the hands of a maladroit child." From his early childhood in Montevideo, son of an English corned beef executive and his Uraguayan secretary, through his years at a Norfolk public school and Oxford, Mountstuart traces his haphazard development as a writer. Early and easy success is succeeded by a long half-century of mediocrity, disappointments and setbacks, both personal and professional, leading him to multiple failed marriages, internment, alcoholism and abject poverty. <p> Mountstuart's sorry tale is also the story of a British way of life in inexorable decline, as his journey takes in the Bloomsbury set, the General Strike, the Spanish Civil War, 1930s Americans in Paris, wartime espionage, New York avant garde art, even the Baader-Meinhof gang--all with a stellar supporting cast. The most sustained and best moment comes mid-book, as Mountstuart gets caught up in one of Britain's murkier wartime secrets, in the company of the here truly despicable Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Elsewhere author William Boyd occasionally misplaces his tongue too obviously in his cheek--the Wall Street Crash is trailed with truly crashing inelegance--but overall <i>Any Human Heart</i> is a witty, inventive and ultimately moving novel. Boyd succeeds in conjuring not only a compelling 20th century but also, in the hapless Logan Mountstuart, an anti-hero who achieves something approaching passive greatness. <i>--Alan Stewart</i>, Amazon.co.uk</p><b>Praise from England for <i>Any Human Heart<br></i></b><i><br></i>"A work of astonishing ventriloquistic virtuosity . . . A brilliant evocation of a past era . . . One finds oneself almost reading the journals as genuine . . . which is quite a feat, because Boyd has skillfully mimicked the artless and random qualities of every diary."<br>- Caroline Moore, <i>Sunday Telegraph<br><br></i>"A book full of delights . . . No one is better than William Boyd at drawing the reader into [a] tale from the very first sentence."<br>- Erica Wagner, <i>The Times<br><br></i>"An excellent picaresque novel, written in a confident, easy-going style . . . <i>Any Human Heart</i> is an old-fashioned, new-fangled tour de force which maintains its brio to the very end. An obvious contender for the next round of literary prizes, it would be considered a worthy and genuinely popular winner of any one of them."<br>- Anita Brookner,<i> The Spectator<br><br></i>"Boyd's terrific powers of storytelling are given free rein here: this is a biography where you don't know the ending, and he keeps you glued and guessing . . . One of Boyd's most enjoyable novels to date: generous, witty and sneakily profound."<br>- Catherine Shoard, <i>Evening Standard<br><br></i>"Compelling . . . An addictively enjoyable read as well as a testament to the endurance of the human heart."<br>- Geordie Grieg, <i>Literary Review<br><br></i>"Astounding. . .The most sincere measure of praise one can attach to William Boyd's new novel is that it ranks alongside <i>The New Confessions</i> as one of his great achievements . . . It also resembles the earlier book in its ambition and spirit, being an account of tumultuous tragicomic life that lasts from one end of the twentieth century to the other. To pull off that trick once is considerable: to do it twice is astounding." <br>&#x2013; Anthony Quinn, <i>The Mail on Sunday<br><br></i></p><h2>All Around Town: The Photographs of Richard Samuel Roberts</h2><p><p>This special picture book offers a window into the African American community of Columbia, South Carolina, during the early twentieth century. While the town is specific, the themes and photographs are universal--weddings and funerals, teachers and preachers, sassy cars and baseball teams, and, of course, families of all sizes. More than half a century later, Richard Samuel Roberts's photographs and Dinah Johnson's lyrical text come together to illustrate the pride, joy, and strength of a bustling community.</p></p><p><p><b>Dinah Johnson</b> is a professor of English at the University of South Carolina, and the editor of <i>The Best of the Brownies' Book</i>. She lives in Columbia, South Carolina, with her family. </p><p><b>Richard Samuel Roberts</b> (1880-1936), a self-taught photographer, documented in pictures the rich lives of the African American citizens of Columbia, South Carolina during the 1920s and 1930s.</p>Johnson's inaugural children's book offers a rare view of life for African Americans living in Columbia, S.C., during the 1920s and '30s, through the photography of Richard Samuel Roberts. This self-taught photographer's carefully composed shots capture the emotion behind his subjects' often stoic facial expressions and reveal all the highlights of daily life: a bride and groom, a funeral procession, a baseball team and a family portrait, to name but a few. The author's spare, breezy text draws youngsters into Roberts's pictures with questions ("Six musicians with their instruments. Would you like to hear their favorite song?"), speculation ("This woman might have been a strict but loving teacher") or factual observations ("Here's a beautiful little baby with a bow"). However, Johnson's text mixes fact (e.g. "the grandson of one of these women just might have grown up to be an astronaut," and one woman is indeed astronaut Charles M. Bolden's grandmother) and fiction (like the alleged teacher cited above, whose actual career is unknown); this may be confusing to some children. Many of the photos are formal portraits of adults, either alone or in groups; child subjects ranging in age from infant to teenager will be particularly appealing to youngsters, especially one displaying a welcome touch of whimsy: a boy pictured with his arm around a tame rooster, which is incongruously perched on a chair indoors. The book's unadorned, album-like design effectively sets off Roberts's crisp, sepia-toned photographs, elegantly framed with simple line borders. Readers will likely be left with a feeling that they've visited a long-ago time that has much in common with their own.

The foot soldiers in these battles operate globally and inside the United States with orders from the White House to do whatever is necessary to hunt down, capture or kill individuals designated by the president as enemies.<br><br>Drawn from the ranks of the Navy SEALs, Delta Force, former Blackwater and other private security contractors, the CIA's Special Activities Division and the Joint Special Operations Command ( JSOC), these elite soldiers operate worldwide, with thousands of secret commandos working in more than one hundred countries. Funded through black budgets,&#x201d; Special Operations Forces conduct missions in denied areas, engage in targeted killings, snatch and grab individuals and direct drone, AC-130 and cruise missile strikes. While the Bush administration deployed these ghost militias, President Barack Obama has expanded their operations and given them new scope and legitimacy.<br><br><i>Dirty Wars</i> follows the consequences of the declaration that the world is a battlefield,&#x201d; as Scahill uncovers the most important foreign policy story of our time. From Afghanistan to Yemen, Somalia and beyond, Scahill reports from the frontlines in this high-stakes investigation and explores the depths of America's global killing machine. He goes beneath the surface of these covert wars, conducted in the shadows, outside the range of the press, without effective congressional oversight or public debate. And, based on unprecedented access, Scahill tells the chilling story of an American citizen marked for assassination by his own government.<br><br>As US leaders draw the country deeper into conflicts across the globe, setting the world stage for enormous destabilization and blowback, Americans are not only at greater risk we are changing as a nation. Scahill unmasks the shadow warriors who prosecute these secret wars and puts a human face on the casualties of unaccountable violence that is now official policy: victims of night raids, secret prisons, cruise missile attacks and drone strikes, and whole classes of people branded as suspected militants.&#x201d; Through his brave reporting, Scahill exposes the true nature of the dirty wars the United States government struggles to keep hidden.<br></p><p>Jeremy Scahill is National Security Correspondent for <i>The Nation</i> magazine and author of the <i>New York Times</i> best-seller <i>Blackwater: The Rise of the World's Most Powerful Mercenary Army</i>. He is a Puffin Foundation Writing Fellow at The Nation Institute. He has reported from Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Yemen, the former Yugoslavia, and elsewhere across the globe. Scahill is a frequent guest on a wide array of programs, appearing regularly on <i>The Rachel Maddow Show</i>, <i>Real Time with Bill Maher</i>, and <i>Democracy Now!</i> He has also appeared on <i>Fresh Air</i>, ABC <i>World News</i>, CBS <i>Evening News</i>, NBC <i>Nightly News</i>, CNN, PBS <i>NewsHour</i>, and Bill Moyers Journal. Scahill's work has sparked several Congressional investigations and won some of journalism's highest honors. He was twice awarded the prestigious George Polk Award, in 1998 for foreign reporting and in 2008 for his book <i>Blackwater</i>. He is also a producer and writer of the film <i>Dirty Wars</i>, which won the cinematography prize at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival.<i>Dirty Wars</i>&nbsp;is the most thorough and authoritative history I've read yet of the causes and consequences of America's post 9/11 conflation of war and national security. I know of no other journalist who could have written it: For over a decade, Scahill has visited the war zones, overt and covert; interviewed the soldiers, spooks, jihadists, and victims; and seen with his own eyes the fruits of America's bipartisan war fever. He risked his life many times over to write this book, and the result is a masterpiece of insight, journalism, and true patriotism.&#x201d;<br><b>Barry Eisler, novelist and former operative in the CIA's Directorate of Operations</b><br><br> There is no journalist in America who has exposed the truth about US government militarism more bravely, more relentlessly and more valuably than Jeremy Scahill.&nbsp;<i>Dirty Wars</i>&nbsp;is highly gripping and dramatic, and of unparalleled importance in understanding the destruction being sown in our name.&#x201d;<br><b>Glenn Greenwald,&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;best-selling author and&nbsp;<i>Guardian</i>&nbsp;columnist</b><br><br> A surefire hit for fans of Blackwater and studded with intriguing, occasionally damning material.&#x201d;<br><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br>"[A] courageous and exhaustive examination of the way a number of clandestine campaigns-full of crimes, coverups, and assassinations-became the United States's main strategy for combating terrorism.

The rings symbolized the indissoluble character of the entity created by the merger of four motor-vehicle brands from the German state of Saxony: Audi, DKW, Horch and Wanderer. This emblem summarized the tradition of car and motorcycle construction in that region, already many decades old, and was also evidence of the companies' determination to continue shaping the future of the motor vehicle. Today, Audi AG makes the same statement with its four-ring emblem: awareness of tradition, orientation toward the future.<br><br>Four Rings: The Audi Story presents the history of Audi comprehensively and in a stimulating, highly informative manner, and includes company and product history data. The reader will be taken on a journey through a century of modern history and will experience the profound economic changes that occurred during this period.

Indeed, London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Madrid, Brussels, Amsterdam are all are mere infants compared to Plovdiv. This is just one of the paradoxes that haunts and defines the New Europe, that part of Europe that was freed from Soviet bondage in 1989, and which is at once both much older than the modern Atlantic-facing power centers of Western Europe while also being much younger than them. Eastern Europe! is a brief and concise (but informative) introduction to Eastern Europe and its myriad customs and history.</p><p>Even those knowledgeable about Western Europe often see Eastern Europe as terra incognito, with a sign on the border declaring &#x201c;Here be monsters.&#x201d; Tomek Jankowski's book is a gateway to understanding both what unites and separates Eastern Europeans from their Western brethren, and how this vital region has been shaped by but has also left its mark on Western Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa. It is a reader-friendly guide to a region that is all too often mischaracterized as remote, insular, and superstitious.</p><p>The book comprises three parts, The first sums up modern linguistic, geographic, and religious contours of Eastern Europe, while the second, main part delves into the region's history, from the earliest origins of Europe up to the end of the Cold War. Closing the book is a section that makes sense of geographical name references -- many cities, rivers, or regions have different names -- and also includes an "Eastern Europe by Numbers" feature that provides charts describing the populations, politics, and economies of the region today. Throughout are boxed-off anecdotes ("Useless Trivia") describing fascinating aspects of Eastern European history or culture.</p></p><p>Tomek Jankowski&#x23af;who was raised in a Polish family in Buffalo, New York&#x23af;worked, studied, and traveled in Poland, Hungary, and other regions of Eastern Europe from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s, gaining a functional literacy of several languages in the process.

Craig Steven Wilder&#x2015;examining both quantitative and qualitative evidence and utilizing cutting-edge literature on race theory&#x2015;demonstrates how ideas of race were born, how they evolved, and how they were carried forth into contemporary society.<br><br>In charting the social history of one of the nation's oldest urban locales, Wilder contends that power relations&#x2015;in all their complexity&#x2015;are the starting point for understanding Brooklyn's turbulent racial dynamics. He spells out the workings of power&#x2015;its manipulation of resources, whether in the form of unfree labor, privileges of citizenship, better jobs, housing, government aid, or access to skilled trades. Wilder deploys an extraordinary spectrum of evidence to illustrate the mechanics of power that have kept African American Brooklynites in subordinate positions: from letters and diaries to family papers of Kings County's slaveholders, from tax records to the public archives of the Home Owners Loan Corporation. <br><br>Wilder illustrates his points through a variety of cases, including banking interests, the rise of Kings County's colonial elite, industrialization and slavery, race-based distribution of federal money in jobs, and mortgage loans during and after the Depression. He delves into the evolution of the Brooklyn ghetto, tracing how housing segregation corralled African Americans in Bedford-Stuyvesant. The book explores colonial enslavement, the rise of Jim Crow, labor discrimination and union exclusion, and educational inequality. Throughout, Wilder uses Brooklyn as a lens through which to view larger issues of race and power on a national level. <br><br>One of the few recent attempts to provide a comprehensive history of race relations in an American city, <i>A Covenant with Color</i> is a major contribution to urban history and the history of race and class in America.</p><p>Examining race, class, and society in Brooklyn over three centuries from the colonial period to the present, <i>A Covenant with Color</i> maps out the genesis, transformation, and dissemination of racial beliefs&#x2015;observing them in action "on the ground."Craig Steven Wilder is assistant professor of history and chair of African American Studies at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts. He was born and raised in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, where he continues to reside during part of the year.</p><h2>Complete Jewish Bible: New International Version, Side-by-Side Reference Edition</h2><p>Features complete texts of a Jewish-style version of both the Old and New Testaments and the New International version side-by-side to enable readers to compare words and phrases.</p><p>"The Complete Jewish Bible, New International Version: Side-by-Side Reference Edition" (2011) contains the 1998 "Complete Jewish Bible," (New Testament translated from the Greek by David H.

Eugene Smith</b></p><p>Famously unabashed, W. Eugene Smith was photography&#x2019;s most celebrated humanist. As a photo essayist at <i>Life </i>magazine in the 1940s and &#x2019;50s, he established himself as an intimate chronicler of human culture. His photographs of war and disaster, villages and metropolises, doctors and midwives, revolutionized the role of images in journalism, transforming photography for decades to come.</p><p>When Smith died in 1978, he left behind eighteen dollars in the bank and forty-four thousand pounds of archives. He was only fifty-nine, but he was flat worn-out. His death certificate read &#x201c;stroke,&#x201d; but, as was said of the immortal jazzman Charlie Parker, Smith died of &#x201c;everything,&#x201d; from drug and alcohol benders to weeklong work sessions with no sleep.</p><p>Lured by the intoxicating trail of people that emerged from Smith&#x2019;s stupefying archive, Sam Stephenson began a quest to trace his footsteps. In <i>Gene Smith&#x2019;s Sink</i>, Stephenson merges traditional biography with rhythmic digressions to revive Smith&#x2019;s life and legacy. Traveling across twenty-nine states, Japan, and the Pacific, Stephenson profiles a lively cast of characters, including the playwright Tennessee Williams, to whom Smith likened himself; the avant-garde filmmaker Stan Brakhage, with whom he once shared a Swiss chalet; the artist Mary Frank, who was married to his friend Robert Frank; the jazz pianists Thelonious Monk and Sonny Clark, whose music was taped by Smith in his loft; and a series of obscure caregivers who helped keep Smith on his feet. The distillation of twenty years of research, <i>Gene Smith&#x2019;s Sink </i>is an unprecedented look into the photographer&#x2019;s potent legacy and the subjects around him.</p></p><p><b>Sam Stephenson</b> is a writer and documentarian. He is the author of <i>Dream Street: W. </i><i>Eugene Smith&#x2019;s Pittsburgh Project</i> and <i>The Jazz </i><i>Loft Project: Photographs and Tapes of W. Eugene </i><i>Smith from 821 Sixth Avenue, 1957&#x2013;1965</i>. His writing has appeared in publications such as <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Paris Review</i>, <i>Tin </i><i>House</i>, and the <i>Oxford American</i>. A lifelong resident of North Carolina, he lives in Durham with his wife and their son.<p>"Fascinating . . . evocative . . . For all that, the wayward individual that emerges out of Stephenson&#x2019;s ambitious &#x201c;wide angle&#x201d; approach remains essentially unknowable, a blur in an otherwise sharply defined portrait of a tougher time and a truly bohemian milieu that already seems impossibly distant." &#x2015;Sean O'Hagan, <i>The Guardian</i></p><p>"We would understand . . . little of Gene Smith's legacy were it not for Stephenson's labors." &#x2015;Vince Passaro, <i>Harper's</i></p><p>"Stephenson has created a fantastic, experimental form for a revealing biographical sketch, taken from voices rarely heard . . . A great read." &#x2015;Anthony Bannon, <i>Buffalo News</i></p><p>"[A] far-reaching, insightful biography . . . Stephenson balances the history and the drama of Smith&#x2019;s life in a skillful distillation of his expansive, careful research." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"Compelling . . . <i>Gene Smith's Sink</i> is a haunting exploration of the photographic mind." &#x2015;<i>Shelf Awareness</i></p><p>&#x201c;Sam Stephenson&#x2019;s earlier books on W. Eugene Smith&#x2019;s Pittsburgh and Jazz Loft projects have established him as the leading authority on defining parts of the photographer&#x2019;s career. Now, in this gripping biography, Stephenson has extended his research to the whole of Smith&#x2019;s turbulent life, adding greatly to our knowledge, understanding, and appreciation of his extraordinary work.&#x201d; &#x2015;Geoff Dyer, author of <i>The Ongoing Moment</i></p><p>Among the things I love about Sam Stephenson&#x2019;s book <i>Gene Smith&#x2019;s Sink</i> is that it&#x2019;s the result of, and an artifact of, <i>lyric</i> research: research that ostensibly originates with a given subject or archive, but very quickly follows leads elsewhere. It&#x2019;s a sort of wandering and associative research, and in this way has as much to do with poetry as it does &#x201c;documentary&#x201d; or &#x201c;nonfiction.&#x201d; Lyric research reminds us that the researcher, the writer, the speaker, is also the subject. But maybe more to the point when speaking about Stephenson's beautiful book, lyric research is a capacious mode of seeing, which seems appropriate, given the book&#x2019;s occasion is the photographer Gene Smith. Given the book&#x2019;s subject, ultimately, is <i>looking</i>. &#x2015;Ross Gay, 2015 National Book Critics Circle Award winner in poetry</p><p>&#x201c;Sam Stephenson&#x2019;s brave and wise book, both more and less than a biography, is a spare demonstration of a huge idea: that nothing is ever finished and nobody is really knowable. And so the roundabout way to know a difficult and extraordinary creator like W. Eugene Smith, or really anyone, may be the most effective and authentic way.&#x201d; &#x2015;Ben Ratliff, author of <i>Every Song Ever</i></p><p>&#x201c;Sound is more present in <i>Gene Smith&#x2019;s Sink</i> than in any book I&#x2019;ve ever read. In this deeply empathic book, the reader leans forward, listening, so that when the call of the chuck-will&#x2019;s-widow occurs on Sixth Avenue, it can be heard. This stunning book resembles a Tennessee Williams play that obsessed Smith; it is the Camino Real of biographies.&#x201d; &#x2015;Margaret Bradham Thornton, editor of <i>Tennessee Williams&#x2019;s Notebooks</i></p><p>&#x201c;The elisions are bold and the detours central. Steadfastly refusing to either lionize or vilify W. Eugene Smith, Sam Stephenson achieves something of a different, more subtle order. What might have been a book about one man&#x2019;s life is instead about many lives&#x2015;human constellations no less interesting than the famous photographer&#x2019;s (very) dark star. Stephenson&#x2019;s twenty-year sojourn into Smith&#x2019;s unique, desperately<br>obsessive leavings births a remarkable, deeply generous book.&#x201d; &#x2015;Jem Cohen, director of <i>Museum Hours</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Gene Smith&#x2019;s Sink </i>is the story of a well-known photographer. It tells a lot about his working life and it tells a lot about his personal life. But what it tells best are things much more complicated.

Son of the Grand Rabbi of Kiev, Aronson rejected Russian director Vsevolod Meyerhold&#39;s communal theater when he fell under the spell of constructivist set designer Alexandra Exter. Arriving in New York in 1923, Aronson faced the predicament of a cosmopolitan artist confronted with a commercial theater that was in many ways backward. Undaunted, he designed sets for Yiddish theater, then worked for Harold Clurman&#39;s Group Theatre on Odets&#39;s Awake and Sing. His association with Jerome Robbins and Harold Prince at last gave him a chance to apply Exter&#39;s ideas of remaking reality in personal terms by making the set a total environment for the show.</p><p></p><h2>Miners of Windber: The Struggles of New Immigrants for Unionization, 1890s-1930s</h2><p><p>In 1897 the Berwind-White Coal Mining Company founded Windber as a company town for its miners in the bituminous coal country of Pennsylvania. <em>The Miners of Windber</em> chronicles the coming of unionization to Windber, from the 1890s, when thousands of new immigrants flooded Pennsylvania in search of work, through the New Deal era of the 1930s, when the miners' rights to organize, join the United Mine Workers of America, and bargain collectively were recognized after years of bitter struggle.</p><p></p><p>Mildred Allen Beik, a Windber native whose father entered the coal mines at age eleven in 1914, explores the struggle of miners and their families against the company, whose repressive policies encroached on every part of their lives. That Windber's population represented twenty-five different nationalities, including Slovaks, Hungarians, Poles, Italians, and Carpatho-Russians, was a potential obstacle to the solidarity of miners. Beik, however, shows how the immigrants overcame ethnic fragmentation by banding together as a class to unionize the mines. Work, family, church, fraternal societies, and civic institutions all proved critical as men and women alike adapted to new working conditions and to a new culture. Circumstance, if not principle, forced miners to embrace cultural pluralism in their fight for greater democracy, reforms of capitalism, and an inclusive, working-class, definition of what it meant to be an American.</p><p></p><p>Beik draws on a wide variety of sources, including oral histories gathered from thirty-five of the oldest living immigrants in Windber, foreign-language newspapers, fraternal society collections, church manuscripts, public documents, union records, and census materials. The struggles of Windber's diverse working class undeniably mirror the efforts of working people everywhere to democratize the undemocratic America they knew. Their history suggests some of the possibilities and limitations, strengths and weaknesses, of worker protest in the early twentieth century.</p></p><p><p>Mildred Allen Beik is an independent scholar living in Atlanta. She has taught at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University and served as a consultant in various public history workshops.</p>&#x201c;Mildred Allen Beik's account of a Pennsylvania coal town in the first three decades of this century is a powerful story of repression and resistance. This is both an important historical story and a lesson that Americans should keep in mind as they debate the merits of unions and the dismantling of the welfare-state in the late twentieth century.&#x201d;<p></p><p>&#x2014;John Bodnar, Indiana University</p></p><h2>Vietnamese Cooking Made Easy: Simple, Flavorful and Quick Meals [Vietnamese Cookbook, 50 Recipes] (Learn To Cook Series)</h2><p><b>Perfect for beginning cooks this beautifully illustrated Vietnamese cookbook provides easy-to-follow directions for quick and delicious Vietnamese dishes.</b> <br><br>Famous for its lively, fresh flavors and artfully composed meals, Vietnamese cooking is the genuine "healthy cuisine" of Asia.

Following the play&#x2019;s astonishing success, &amp;&amp;LB&amp;&amp;RJ. M.

Thus begins a great classic of children's literature that we all remember as magical. What we tend to forget, because the tale of Peter Pan and Neverland has been so relentlessly boiled down, hashed up, and coated in saccharine, is that J.M. Barrie's original version is also witty, sophisticated, and delightfully odd. The Darling children, Wendy, John, and Michael, live a very proper middle-class life in Edwardian London, but they also happen to have a Newfoundland for a nurse. The text is full of such throwaway gems as "Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter Pan when she was tidying up her children's minds," and is peppered with deliberately obscure vocabulary including "embonpoint," "quietus," and "pluperfect." Lest we forget, it was written in 1904, a relatively innocent age in which a plot about abducted children must have seemed more safely fanciful. Also, perhaps, it was an age that expected more of its children's books, for <i>Peter Pan</i> has a suppleness, lightness, and intelligence that are "literary" in the best sense. In a typical exchange with the dastardly Captain Hook, Peter Pan describes himself as "youth... joy... a little bird that has broken out of the egg," and the author interjects: "This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very pinnacle of good form." A book for adult readers-aloud to revel in--and it just might teach young listeners to fly.

In October 1967, orders came down to the 2nd North Vietnamese Army Division commanding them to join with local Viet Cong units and seize the city of Da Nang in the coming Tet Offensive. When the time came, the division was so battered from its seven-month campaign in the Que Son Valley that it failed to carry out its mission. Only one platoon was to make it inside the city limits of Da Nang. Had it not been for the violent struggles in the valley, Da Nang may have suffered the same fate as the city of Hue.</p></p><p><p>The NVA came at Murray&#x2019;s men by the score: in a whirlwind of violence, hard on the heels of mortars that mushroomed across the knoll, throwing hot, sharp steel in every direction; within lanes, marked by tracers of Soviet-made machine guns and small arms that chain-sawed every bush, sapling, and blade of grass to stubble; in platoon formation, firing from the hip; in squads, firing and maneuvering their three-man fire teams; singly, men orphaned by the Marines&#x2019; return fire but still on their feet and attacking. The NVA kept coming at the Marines in a flood, like water from a burst dam, flowing around the strong positions, threatening to carry away the weak, and then trying to come together on the far side, attempting to isolate and surround small clumps of resistance&#x2014;and they nearly succeeded. Had it not been for the outstanding courage of the individual Marines and their close air support, the entire company would most likely have been butchered on the knoll.</p> <p>&#x2014;from <i>The Road of 10,000 Pains</i><b></b></p> <p><b>Praise for <i>Road of 10,000 Pains</i></b></p> <p><i>Road of 10,000 Pains </i>has the first and only accurate description of Foxtrot Company, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marine&#x2019;s combat operation on 21 April 1967 that evolved into Operation Union.

Suzuki</h2><p>The history of Zen Buddhism and a study of its philosophy and practices</p><p>The premier metaphysician of the 20th century, Martin Heidegger, once said in regard to D. T. Suzuki, "If I understand this man correctly, this is what I have been trying to say in all my writings." Roman Catholic writer Thomas Merton, analytical psychologist Carl Jung, social psychologist Erich Fromm, avant-garde musician John Cage, writer and social critic Alan Watts, poet Gary Snyder -- all influential in their own rights, claim a debt to Mr. Suzuki and his writings, the most representative of which are gathered here in <i>Zen Buddhism</i>. An intellectual understanding of Zen begins with this book.No other figure in history has played a bigger part in opening the West to Buddhism than the eminent Zen author, D.T. Suzuki, and in this reissue of his best work readers are given the very heart of Zen teaching. <i>Zen Buddhism</i>, which sold more than 125,000 as an Anchor paperback after its publication in 1956, includes a basic historical background as well as a thorough overview of the techniques for Zen practice. Concepts and terminology such as <i>satori, zazen,</i> and <i>koans,</i> as well as the various elements of this philosophy are all given clear explanations. But while Suzuki takes nothing for granted in the reader's understanding of the fundamentals, he does not give a merely rudimentary overview. Each of the essays included here, particularly those on the unconscious mind and the relation of Zen to Western philosophy, go far beyond other sources for their penetrating insights and timeless wisdom.<p></p><p>What is most important about D.T. Suzuki's work, however--and what comes across so powerfully in these selections--is his unparalleled ability to communicate the experiential aspect of Zen. The intensity here with which Zen philosophy comes to life is without parallel in the canon of Buddhist literature. Suzuki stands apart from all teachers before or since because of his exceptional ability to eloquently capture in words the seemingly inexpressible essence of Zen.</p></p><h2>Badge of Glory (Volume 1) (The Royal Marines Saga, 1)</h2><p>Travel through Britain's military history with a proud seafaring family, the Blackwoods, and the service tradition in which they make their careers&#x2014;the Royal Marines.

A Trappist monk himself, Pennington here offers insight into the cloistered existence, illuminating Merton's conviction that the monastic discipline is the surest path to achieving inner peace and freedom. He traces the course of Merton's progress from worldly young man to eremite and, drawing on Merton's writings and the views of those who knew him, presents an evocative portrayal of Merton's development into one of the charismatic religious personages of our age. While at times verging on the adulatory, (Pennington finds Merton's controversial romantic liaison with a woman a sign of spiritual strength), this account of a spiritual journey will charm those intrigued by this paradoxical figure. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.Twenty years after his tragic death, interest in Thomas Merton is more widespread than ever.

But if one does not know that the natures of substances may be opposed to each other, and one consumes them altogether indiscriminately, the vital organs will be thrown out of harmony and disastrous consequences will soon arise. Therefore, those who wish to nurture their lives must carefully avoid doing such damage to themselves.<br> [Chia Ming, <i>Essential Knowledge for Eating and Drinking,</i> 1368] </p><p> One of the great advantages of learning Tao is that the same basic principles apply to everything from the macrocosmic to the microscopic. In the case of diet, the overriding Taoist principle of balance between Yin and Yang is established by harmonizing the Four Energies and Five Flavors in foods. </p><p> The Four Energies in food are hot, warm, cool and cold. These categories define the nature and the intensity of energy released in the human system when food is digested. Hot and warm foods belong to Yang; cool and cold foods belong to Yin. The former are stimulating and generate heat, while the latter are calming and cool the organs. </p><p> The Five Flavors are more subtle distinctions based on the Five Elemental Activities: sweet (earth), bitter (fire), sour (wood), pungent (metal) and salty (water). Each of the Five Flavors has a 'natural affinity' <i>(gui-jing)</i> for one of the five 'solid' Yin organs and its Yang counterpart: sweet influences pancreas/stomach; bitter moves to the heart/small intestine; sour has affinity for the liver/gallbladder; pungent affects the lungs/large intestine; and salty associates with the kidneys/bladder. </p><p> The therapeutic effects of the Four Energies and Five Flavors are as follows: </p><p> * Cool and cold Yin foods calm the vital organs and are recommended for summer menus, as well as for combating 'hot' Yang diseases such as fever and hypertension. Yin foods include soy beans, bamboo shoots, watermelon, white turnips, cabbage, pears, squash and lemons. </p><p> * Warm and hot Yang foods stimulate the vital organs, generate body heat and are recommended for winter consumption, as well as palliatives for 'cold' Yin diseases such as anemia, chills and fatigue. Yang foods include beef, mutton, chicken, alcohol, mango and chilies. </p><p> * Sweet 'earth' foods disperse stagnant energy, promote circulation, nourish vital energy and harmonize the stomach. Corn, peas, dates, ginseng and licorice are examples of sweet foods. </p><p> * Bitter 'fire' foods such as rhubarb and bitter melon tend to dry the system, balance excess dampness, and purge the bowels. </p><p> * Sour 'wood' foods such as olives and pomegranate are astringent, tend to solidify the contents of the digestive tract, stop diarrhea and remedy prolapse of the colon. </p><p> * Salty 'water' foods such as kelp soften and moisten tissues and facilitate bowel movements. </p><p> * Pungent 'metal' goods such as ginger, garlic and chili neutralize and disperse accumulated toxins in the body. </p><p> Taoists balance their diets according to favorable combinations of energies and flavors and strictly avoid combinations that conflict. They also avoid excessive consumption of any single variety of food-energy. For example, frequent excessive consumption of 'hot' fatty Yang foods can cause fevers, heartburn, congestion, chest stagnation and other unpleasant effects of 'heat-energy excess'. As this excess 'evil heat' seeks escape from the body, carbuncles and absesses may develop. Too much pungent food can cause gastro-intestinal distress, upset the stomach and result in hemorrhoids. Even the freshest, most wholesome foods are rendered nutritionally useless if consumed in combinations that interfere with digestion, cause putrefaction and fermentation, block assimilation and cause internal energy conflicts. </p><p> <b>Mother Nature's Menu</b> </p><p> When formulating personal dietary guidelines, it is helpful first to determine your own basic metabolic type, of which there are three: vegetarian, carnivore and balanced. The vegetarian and carnivorous types each represent about 25 per cent of the general population, with the remaining 50 per cent falling into the balanced category. These human metabolic types stem from the prehistoric switch by some segments of the human species from a fruit and nut based diet to a meat diet. </p><p> Vegetarian metabolisms are 'slow oxidizers', which means that they burn sugars and carbohydrates slowly. Because the body must burn sugar in order to provide sufficient energy to digest meat and fat, slow oxidizers have trouble burning sugar fast enough to efficiently digest large quantities of meat, eggs, fish and other concentrated animal proteins. Consequently, large doses of protein foods tend to make vegetarian types feel tired and sluggish after meals. An easy test for metabolic type is to eat a large steak or a whole chicken and see how you feel afterward. If it leaves you feeling 'wiped out', mentally depressed and lethargic, then you probably tend towards a slow-oxidizing vegetarian metabolism, in which case you should restrict protein and fat consumption and favor vegetables, fruits and carbohydrates in your diet. If a large intake of concentrated animal protein leaves you feeling strong, vital and mentally alert, then you probably lean towards a fast-oxidizing carnivorous metabolism. </p><p> Since carnivorous metabolisms burn sugar and carbohydrates very rapidly, excess consumption of sugar or starch tends to make them excessively nervous and agitated due to overstimulation of the nervous system. Fast oxidizers derive energy by digesting large quantities of animal fats and proteins, which are sent to the liver for conversion into glycogen. The liver then dispenses the glycogen into the bloodstream in the form of glucose -- the only form of fuel the body can burn -- in gradual measured doses, as needed. That's why fast oxidizers require a steady supply of protein and fat in their diets and should restrict intake of sugars and starches. </p><p> Fortunately, most of us have balanced metabolisms that can handle both varieties of food when properly combined. Although our digestive <i>tracts</i> were originally designed by nature for a diet of fruit and vegetables, our digestive <i>systems</i> have evolved the capacity to produce the gastric juices required to digest the meat that became part of the human diet 50,000-100,000 years ago. If large quantities of animal protein don't leave you feeling depleted, and if large doses of sugar and starch don't make you nervous, then you are probably a balanced metabolizer who needs only worry about selecting wholesome foods from both categories and combining them properly for consumption. In the Tao of diet, however, these are just the first steps in regulating diet. Season and climate, for example, must also be considered in order to ensure that the extreme external cold winter is balanced by the extra internal heat of Yang-foods, hot summer weather is complemented by cooling Yin-foods, dry climates are compensated with extra moisturizing foods, and so forth. Foods consumed out of harmony with season and climate can cause all sorts of problems, including skin eruptions, constipation, gas, fatigue and bad breath. </p><p> Taoists tend to favor local produce because it is far more likely to be fresh and brimming with the vitality of its own <i>chee.</i> Today, the modern food-processing industry, in conjunction with high-speed transport, has made it possible to eat Florida oranges in Alaska, frozen prawns in the middle of the desert and all sorts of processed packaged 'junk food' any time of day or night, anywhere on earth. As a result, modern diets are completely out of synchrony with the natural prevailing conditions of geography, season and unseen cosmic forces. </p><p> Taoists also make a point of eating foods with natural affinities for their weakest organs and related energy systems. Taoist diets aim at strengthening four major systems in the body: digestive, excretory, respiratory and circulatory. When these four functional systems are properly nourished, harmonized and healthy, the health and vitality of the entire organism are assured. </p><p> A major goal of Taoist diets is to enhance sexual potency by stimulating sexual glands and strengthening sexual organs. The purpose here is not to increase sexual pleasure -- though that is a definite side benefit -- but rather to increase the body's store of hormones, semen and other forms of 'vital essence' required for optimum vitality and immunity. Sexual essence provides our greatest internal source of <i>chee,</i> and sexual potency is a major indicator of good health. </p><p> Since meat forms such a large part of Western diets, a few Taoist guidelines on meat consumption should be helpful. The great Tang physician Sun Ssu-mo and other Taoist dieticians have always warned against the long-range ill effects of eating large quantities of domestic animal meats, such as beef and pork. The only domestic meat they regarded as safe and healthy for the human system was dog, and that was recommended only for its potent warming effects during the intense cold of mid-winter. The reason that domestic animals are such a poor source of human nutrition is that their own diets consist mainly of kitchen slops, garbage and dried straw. Today, the situation is further aggravated by all the synthetic hormones, antibiotics and other drugs routinely fed to livestock. </p><p> Taoists have always recommended wild game as the most nutritionally beneficial type of meat for man. Venison is especially good, primarily because deer feed on all sorts of wild nuts, leaves, berries, barks and other herbs which appear in the Chinese pharmocopeia as remedies for man. The benefits of a wild deer's herbal diet are naturally transmitted to your own system when you eat its meat, just as all the chemical drugs injected into livestock today are transferred to your system when you eat a hamburger or fried chicken. </p><p> Note, however, that you will gain very little nutritional benefit from even the freshest wild game if you cook it 'to death'. Any meat that is suitable for human consumption should be eaten as rare as possible, preferably raw or at least partly raw. Steak tartare and Carpaccio are good examples of raw beef dishes that are brimming with their own natural enzymes and are delicious as well. Japanese <i>sashimi</i> (raw fish) is even better; indeed <i>sashimi</i> is arguably the most nutritionally potent, enzymerich, naturally digestible form of animal protein on Mother Nature's entire menu, a fact reflected by the longevity of the Japanese people. Taoists always recommend wild fish from seas and rivers over domestic fish raised in stagnant ponds and fed on 'fish chow'. </p><p> The same principle applies to chicken. Chinese physicians today still recommend that their patients consume only <i>tu-ji</i> ('earth chickens') and avoid <i>yang-ji</i> ('cultivated chickens'). Earth chickens are those left to roam about fields and forests to forage for themselves, rather than being fed the artificial, denatured diets of domestic fowl. </p><p> In order to prevent putrefaction, promote digestion and facilitate rapid elimination of wastes, all meals in which cooked meats form the major element should be supplemented with a dose of active proteolytic ('protein-digesting') enzymes, which are readily available at health and food stores today. </p><p> You may assist rather than interfere with Mother Nature's digestive principles by observing the following basic Taoist dietary guidelines: </p><p> * Eat sparingly, and you will live a long and healthy life. The basic Taoist measure is to eat till you are 70-80 per cent full. Mother Nature invariably punishes gluttons with all sorts of misery. The human body simply cannot utilize the enormous quantities and complex combinations of food with which civilized, sedentary man tends to gorge himself daily. </p><p> * Chew food thoroughly before swallowing it. This applies especially to carbohydrates, which require initial digestion by the alkaline ptyalin enzyme in the saliva of the mouth. Gandhi's advice on this subject rings with the wisdom of Tao: 'Drink your food and chew your beverages', which means that solid foods should be chewed to liquid form before swallowing, and liquids should be swallowed as slowly as solid food. </p><p> * Avoid extreme hot and cold temperatures in foods and beverages. Excessively hot soup, for example, irritates the tender lining of the mouth and esophagus, which impairs salivation and peristalsis. One of the worst digestive offenses is to drink ice water or other freezing cold fluids with meals. Such freezing infusions on a stomach full of food freeze shut the tiny ducts which secrete gastric juices in the stomach, thereby halting digestion and permitting putrefaction and fermentation to occur instead. By the time the temperature of the stomach returns to normal, it is too late for proper digestion to commence. In fact, any beverage taken in large quantities together with food dilutes the gastric medium and impairs digestion. Wine and beer, however, are exceptions because they are fermented (i.e. pre-digested) and thus they actually assist digestion when taken in moderate quantities. Even the Bible advises one to 'take a little wine for the stomach's sake'. </p><p> <b>The Human Dietary Devolution</b> </p><p> Modern man bristles with pride on his 'evolution' from cave man to space traveler and looks upon his primitive past with disdain. When it comes to diet, however, the human species has experienced a severe 'devolution' in eating habits, a devolution sparked by the much ballyhooed advent of civilization, an event that has driven a permanent wedge between man and nature. </p><p> For millions of years prior to the tiny drop in the bucket of time which we call 'history', humans and other primates lived entirely on diets of coarse, fibrous foods gathered in nature and consumed raw. Throughout the realm of nature, animals that rely on diets with a high ratio of indigestible fibrous bulk and low concentrations of protein have evolved relatively long digestive tracts, whereas carnivores such as lions and tigers evolved short tracts. The human alimentary canal, which winds its way from mouth to anus with 40 feet of tubing, is one of the longest digestive tracts relative to body weight in all of nature. </p><p> Man's dietary devolution took a serious turn for the worse when he 'advanced' to become a hunter of animals and adopted meat as his major dietary staple. This occurred primarily in the northern hemisphere, where flesh became the only viable source of food in winter. Those human populations that switched to meat developed digestive juices and metabolisms capable of extracting nutrients from animal fats and proteins, even though their digestive tracts remained forever fixed in the vegetarian mold. This development is the source of the two basic metabolic types in man, one geared towards a bulky diet of fresh fruits and vegetables, the other to a fiberless diet of flesh. </p><p> Agriculture triggered the final stage of human dietary degeneration. When grain became the main staple of the human diet, a new element was introduced into the digestive tract, an element not at all intended by nature as food for man. That culprit is starch. The fact that grains are ...</p></p><h2>Raiders of the Nile: A Novel of the Ancient World (Novels of Ancient Rome)</h2><p><p>In 88 B.C. it seems as if all the world is at war.

A towering frieze along one side depicts the exploits of the world conqueror. The moment of inspiration that gave birth to the city itself, some 240 years ago, is vividly depicted on the frieze: Alexander stands atop a sand dune, staring at the shore and the sea beyond while his architects, surveyors, and engineers gaze up at him in wonder, clutching their various instruments. <br>So realistically sculpted and painted was this massive frieze that I almost expected the giant image of the conqueror to suddenly turn his head and peer down at us as we scurried below him, heading toward the building&#x2019;s entrance. I would not have been surprised to see him raise an eyebrow and inquire in a booming, godlike voice, &#x201c;Where in Hades do you fellows think you&#x2019;re going? Why are some of you brandishing swords? And what is that the rest of you carry&#x2014;a battering ram?&#x201d; <br>But Alexander remained immobile and mute as my companions and I rushed past him and surged into the colonnaded entranceway. <br>On this day the tomb was closed to visitors. An iron gate barred entry to the vestibule. I was among those who carried the battering ram. We pivoted into formation, perpendicular to the gate. As Artemon, our leader, counted to three, we heaved the ram forward, then back, then forward again with all our might. The gate shuddered and buckled at the impact. <br>&#x201c;Again!&#x201d; shouted Artemon. &#x201c;On my count! One&#x2014;two&#x2014; <i>three</i>!&#x201d; <br>Each time the ram butted against it, the gate moaned and shrieked, as if it were a living thing. On our fourth heave, the gate flew open. Those of us carrying the battering ram retreated back into the street and tossed it aside while the vanguard of our party, led by Artemon, rushed through the sundered gate. I drew my sword and followed them into the vestibule. Dazzling mosaics celebrating the life of Alexander decorated every surface from the floor to the domed ceiling high above, where an opening admitted sunlight to shimmer across the millions of pieces of colored glass and stone. <br>Ahead of me, I saw that only a handful of armed men offered resistance. These guardians of the tomb looked surprised, frightened, and ready to run&#x2014;and who could blame them? We greatly outnumbered them. They also looked rather old to be bearing arms, with weathered, wrinkled faces and gray eyebrows. <br>Why were there so few guards, and why were they of such a low grade? Artemon had told us that the city was in chaos, wracked by daily riots. All the most able-bodied soldiers had been summoned by King Ptolemy to protect the royal palace, leaving only this feeble handful to defend the Tomb of Alexander. Perhaps the king thought that even the most violent mob would never dare to violate such a sacred place, especially in broad daylight. But Artemon had out-foxed him. &#x201c;Our greatest advantage will be the element of surprise,&#x201d; he had told us, and it appeared that he was correct. <br>I heard a clash of swords, followed by screams. I had deliberately volunteered to man the battering ram, so as to avoid being on the front line of whatever battle might take place. I wanted no blood on my hands, if I could possibly avoid it. But was I really less guilty than my comrades ahead of me, who were gleefully hacking away with their swords? <br>You may wonder why I was taking part in such a criminal act. I had been compelled to join these bandits against my will. Still, might I not have slipped away at some point and escaped? Why did I stay with them? Why did I continue to follow Artemon&#x2019;s orders? Did I do so out of fear, or misplaced loyalty, or simple greed for the share of gold we had all been promised? <br>No. I did what I did for <i>her</i>&#x2014;for the sake of that crazy slave girl who had somehow got herself kidnapped by these bandits. <br>What sort of Roman would stoop to such criminal behavior for the sake of a girl, and a mere slave at that? The blinding Egyptian sun must have driven me mad, that I should find myself in such a spot! <br>As I rushed through the vestibule, toward the wide corridor that led to the sarcophagus, I realized I was whispering her name: &#x201c;Bethesda!&#x201d; Was she still well, and unharmed? Would I ever see her again? <br>I slipped on a pool of blood. As I spun my arms to balance myself, I looked down and saw the pale face of a fallen guard. His lifeless eyes were wide open and his mouth was set in a grimace. The poor old fellow might have been someone&#x2019;s grandfather! <br>One of my companions helped to steady me. <i>Careless fool!</i> I thought. <i>You might have broken your neck! You might have fallen on your own sword! What would have become of Bethesda then?</i> <br>I heard the sounds of another battle ahead of us, but its duration was brief. By the time I stepped into the chamber, only one guard remained standing, and even as I watched, Artemon stabbed him in the belly. The poor fellow crumpled lifeless to the hard granite floor. His sword fell beside him with a clatter, and then a hush fell over the crowded room. <br>Lamps set in niches in the walls provided the only illumination. Though it was bright daylight outside, here all was dim light and shadow. Before us, raised upon a low dais, was a massive sarcophagus. In form and style it was partly Egyptian, like the angular mummy cases of the ancient pharaohs, and partly Greek, with carvings along the sides that depicted the exploits of Alexander&#x2014;the taming of the steed Bucephalus, the triumphal entry into the Gates of Babylon, the terrifying battle with the elephant cavalry of the Indus. The gleaming sarcophagus, made of solid gold, was encrusted with precious stones, including the dazzling green gem called the emerald mined from the mountains of southernmost Egypt. The sarcophagus glittered in the flickering light of the lamps, an object of breathtaking splendor and of value beyond calculation. <br>&#x201c;Well, what do you make of that?&#x201d; <br>I shivered, as if startled from a dream. Artemon stood beside me. His bright eyes sparkled and his handsome features seemed to glow in the ruddy light. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s magnificent,&#x201d; I whispered. &#x201c;More magnificent than I ever imagined.&#x201d; <br>He grinned, flashing perfect white teeth, then raised his voice. &#x201c;Did you hear that, men? Even our Roman comrade is impressed! And Pecunius&#x201d;&#x2014;that was the name by which he knew me&#x2014;&#x201c;is not easily impressed, for has he not seen the Seven Wonders of the World, as he never tires of telling us? What do you say, Pecunius&#x2014;is this sarcophagus the equal of those Wonders?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Can it really be made of solid gold?&#x201d; I whispered. &#x201c;The weight must be enormous!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yet we have the means to move it.&#x201d; <br>Even as Artemon spoke, some of the men brought forth winches, pulleys, lengths of rope, and wooden shims. Another group appeared from the vestibule wheeling a sturdy wagon down the wide corridor. The wagon was loaded with a lidded wooden crate made especially for our cargo. Artemon had thought of everything. Suddenly he looked to me like the young Alexander as depicted on the frieze of the building, a visionary surrounded by adoring architects and engineers. Artemon knew what he wanted and had a plan to achieve it. He inspired fear in his enemies and confidence in his followers. He knew how to bend others to his will. Certainly he had succeeded at making me do as he wanted, against all my better judgment. <br>The wagon was wheeled into place alongside the dais. The top of the crate was lifted off. The inside was padded with blankets and straw. <br>A hoisting mechanism was deployed to remove the lid of the sarcophagus. <br>&#x201c;Should we be opening the sarcophagus?&#x201d; I said, feeling a prickle of superstitious dread. <br>&#x201c;The lid and the sarcophagus are both very heavy,&#x201d; said Artemon. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll be easier to manipulate if we separate them and lift them one at a time.&#x201d; <br>As the lid began to rise above the sarcophagus, a thought occurred to me. <br>&#x201c;What will become of the body?&#x201d; I asked. <br>Artemon looked at me sidelong but did not speak. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to hold it for ransom, are you?&#x201d; <br>He laughed at the look on my face. &#x201c;Of course not. The remains of Alexander will be handled with utmost respect, and will be left here where they belong, in his tomb.&#x201d; <br>Robbing a mummified corpse of its sarcophagus hardly constituted respect, I thought. Artemon seemed to be amused by my misgivings. <br>&#x201c;Here, Pecunius, let&#x2019;s have a look at the mummy before we remove it from the sarcophagus. They say the state of preservation is quite remarkable.&#x201d; <br>He took my arm and together we stepped onto the dais. As the lid was hoisted onto the wagon, the two of us peered over the edge of the sarcophagus. <br>So it came to pass that I, Gordianus of Rome, at the age of twenty-two, in the city of Alexandria and in the company of cutthroats and bandits, found myself face to face with the most famous mortal who ever lived. <br>For a man who had been dead over two hundred years, the conqueror&#x2019;s features were remarkably well preserved. His eyes were closed, as if he slept, but his eyelashes were perfectly intact. I could almost imagine that he might suddenly blink and gaze back at me. <br>&#x201c;Look out!&#x201d; someone shouted. <br>I turned around to see that we had company&#x2014;not royal soldiers, but a handful of regular citizens, no doubt outraged at the desecration of their city&#x2019;s most sacred monument. A few had daggers. The rest were armed only with clubs and stones. <br>As Artemon&#x2019;s men fell on the newcomers, cutting them down and driving them back, one of the angry citizens raised his arm and took aim at me. I saw the jagged rock hurtle toward me. <br>Artemon grabbed my arm and pulled me sharply to one side, but too late. I felt a sharp blow against my head. The world turned upside down as I fell from the dais onto the wagon, striking my head against one corner of the crate. Groggily, I drew back and saw blood&#x2014;my blood&#x2014;on the wood. Then everything went black. <br>How had I come to such a sorry pass? <br>Let me tell you the story. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2014 by Steven Saylor <br></p><h2>Arnhem 1944: The Airborne Battle, 17-26 September</h2><p>The battle of Arnhem was meant to end the war in Europe. The Germans were in retreat from Normmandy, apparently beaten. Montgomery decided on a bold gamble - three airborne divisions were to drop behind enemy lines, seize the bridges across the great rivers of Holland and open the heart of Germany to the advancing Allied armies. Unfortunately it all went wrong. The initial operation was successful and the areas taken by the American paratroopers were secured by ground troops. However, these troops could not reach Arnhem quickly enough. Meanwhile in the centre of the town of Arnhem, only a small part of the British First Airborne Division had reached - but not taken - the main bridge across the Rhine. Most of the British force was held up on the outskirts of the town by German units that had turned out to be far stronger than expected - a major intelligence failure. After nine davs of fighting, the survivors of the division managed to retreat to Allied lines. It was not until many months later that the Allies were able to finally cross the Rhine in strength and enter Germany. Blending research based on original documents with interviews with over 500 participants, this book tells the story of the battle for Arnhem.</p><p>The subject of Middlebrook's thirteenth outstanding book is the same battle Cornelius Ryan treated more broadly in his best-seller <i>A Bridge Too Far</i>. Middlebrook's focus is tighter, though--almost entirely on the British airborne troops who landed at the far end of the Allied thrust and became mostly casualties but also on the Dutch who helped and then suffered with them. Within this framework, Middlebrook has done as well as ever, following his usual practice of weaving printed sources and a mass of interviews into a seamless narrative in which both vivid personal experiences and the technicalities of the background are brought out so as to be accessible to just about any level of readership. Middlebrook says this invaluable companion to Ryan's <i>Bridge</i> may be his last book; any serious lover of military history will hope otherwise. <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>Difference and Repetition (European Perspectives: A Series in Social Thought and Cultural Criticism)</h2><p>This brilliant exposition of the critique of identity is a classic in contemporary philosophy and one of Deleuze's most important works.

Successfully defended in 1969 as Deleuze&#39;s main thesis toward his Doctorat d&#39;Etat at the Sorbonne, the work has been central in initiating the shift in French thought away from Hegel and Marx, towards Nietzsche and Freud. The text follows the development of two central concepts, those of pure difference and complex repetition. It shows how the two concepts are related - difference implying divergence and decentering, and repetition implying displacement and disguising. In its explication the work moves deftly between Hegel, Kierkegaard, Freud, Althusser, and Nietzsche to establish a fundamental critique of Western metaphysics.

The author explores the variety of barn styles, pays tribute to the craftsmanship of their builders, and chronicles the lives and times of both the barns and those who built them. <b>Barn Building</b> is illustrated throughout with contemporary color interior and exterior photographs, historic black-and-white photos, and the author's own illustrations. </p><p> The barns featured are in various European and North American styles.

His articles and photographs on historical buildings are published widely. He is the author of <i>Barns of the Queen's Bush</i>. </p><p><b> Introduction </b></p><p> This book celebrates barns. It explores their variety; pays tribute to the craftsmanship that formed them; acknowledges those who built them and the life they led. It also tells the story of my trips to see every one of these barns, visiting with people I had never met before but with whom I shared a bond. I learned about their lives through the centerpiece of their farms, the barns. </p><p> Farming has evolved immensely since Europeans settled this continent in the seventeenth century. We have moved from sickles to grain cradles to horse-drawn reapers to threshers and combines. The last one hundred years especially have seen even greater changes in farming, as technology's rapid advance has transformed agriculture in the USA and Canada -- and with it a way of life. </p><p> Barn building has kept pace with the times. For pioneers, log barns were the practical buildings of the day. As communities became established, settlers were able to accomplish the craftsmanship of timber-frame Dutch and English barns and long, low Quebec-style barns. Such designs came from ethnicity, the country of settlers' origin and the building techniques early pioneers brought. Dutch and Swiss settlers built boxy structures with huge timbers available from the virgin forests in New York State. The English brought the tall, elegant, post and beam structures that were practical to build and adapted well to the New World climate. The French introduced a form that came with building specifications written down by the governor of New France. </p><p> Although ethnicity played a large part in early barn construction, builders also adapted their techniques to North American weather. After all, it was our extreme climate that demanded barns. The colder the winters, the bigger the barns. By the beginning of the 1800s barns were recognizably New World in nature, adapting to local conditions and using local materials. Dutch barn designs evolved using smaller timbers; the English barn was expanded and stables added under its frame. The concept for bank barns originally arrived with the Germans, but the buildings soon grew larger and wider, with ramps at the gable ends as well. </p><p> During this period life on farms pretty well carried on in its traditional form, with members of the family having their own specific tasks. Men built barns, cared for animals and tended fields, fixed fences, cleaned out stables, pruned orchards and maintained farm equipment. Women raised children, prepared food, washed laundry, prepared herbal medicines, sewed clothes, made soap, fed chickens, churned butter and cooked feasts for barn raisings. Children as young as three or four gathered berries and nuts, weeded gardens, picked stones from fields and helped mother with washing and peeling vegetables. The whole family came together for butchering a pig or a cow. </p><p> On an even a bigger scale, communities helped one another in a number of ways, from "bees" for quilting to threshing to raising barn structures. If a neighbor needed a hand, help was on the way. Socially, neighbors would see each other regularly, eat together often, go to church and attend each other's weddings and funerals. So often I have heard from the older folks I talked with, "We couldn't have done it without the help of neighbors." </p><p> That rural social fabric has been frayed, but strands remain in the historic farms still dotted across the USA and Canada. It's that heritage that I wanted to celebrate and learn from. </p><p> My barn discovery travels have taken me to Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, Ontario, and Quebec. The many miles I have driven have rewarded me with an untold number of exhilarating and unforgettable experiences. I have visited and photographed every one of the barns in this book and was fortunate to enter many of them. No two barns I have seen were alike. Even those built by the same builder were fine-tuned to the owner's specifications, the lay of the land and type of farming operation. Barns were "handmade," not built inside a factory mass-producing trusses and walls that today do make many barns exactly the same. </p><p> We define heritage as an inheritance from the people before us which can be learned from and built upon. Many farm families value their old barns as their link with the past. Barns help us perceive why we are what we are today. My travels have certainly made me understand even more the richness of our landscape in rural history. Notching timbers is a skill that has been handed down through the generations but I have been lucky enough to learn it by teaching myself and from books. I learned to imagine the structure, then to put that concept onto wood joinery. It takes patience and perseverance, richly rewarded in having a mortise and tenon fit precisely. </p><p> Before notching a timber frame, I start by ordering the timbers at the local Amish sawmill. Since they don't have a phone, it means a two-mile trip. Often teenagers and young men work the demanding jobs at these sawmills. Dressed in their traditional homemade dark blue jackets and pants, often ripped and repaired, with either straw or black, wide-brimmed hats, they first talk with me about the weather and local gossip. They love to laugh and so humour is much a part of our conversation. Then, with my timber list in hand, we'll head out toward the log yard, to choose from the great piles of pine or white ash logs large enough to make the beams I need. We check them for soundness and make sure they are straight. </p><p> A few weeks later, I'll drive over with my trusty (if somewhat rusty) 1979 Dodge pick-up truck and a sturdy wagon. Green-cut timbers are heavy, and it takes a big heave-ho to load them all on the wagon and back of the truck. Sometimes I take two trips, depending on the size of the order. I stack and let them dry for a few weeks, in the meantime drawing up the cutting list, deciding on the lengths and what notches I will need to cut. </p><p> Traditionally, timber framers used augers or boring machines to drill out the holes for the mortises, the hardest joint to notch, since they involve removing solid wood leaving a square hole. I used a boring machine to notch my house frame before we had electricity here but, when the "wire" came, I began using electric drills. The final cleaning out of the notch I still do by hand chiseling. It takes patience, experience, and physical endurance. I love the feel of a large, sharp chisel that can take off a sixteenth of an inch or one inch of wood, always with the pounding of the mallet, the flying chips of wood. Although notching is a lot of physical work, it challenges my mind too. I twirl the structure around in my head, making sure I am notching correctly. A single timber may have many notches and one mistake would mean days of work put aside for the stove. Nothing feels better in the world for me than to see a pile of timbers, all notched, waiting to be put together as a house or barn. </p><p> Raising a timber frame still excites me. Although a hundred years have passed since barn raisings were common, they have a peculiar and enduring fascination for us. They carry the aura of a past, of strong community bonds. Raisings brought the whole neighborhood together. Besides the practicality of putting up a barn frame for a local farmer, the raisings also forged new relationships -- friendships and sometimes life-time marriages. </p><p> I find something incredibly moving when a pile of squared timbers lying inert in the morning has been transformed by nightfall into a graceful yet immensely strong and durable frame held together with nothing but pegs of wood. Perhaps the grassroots human scale of it all touches everyone who participates in a raising. </p><p> Of course I do acknowledge that many old barns are falling down from neglect, not fitting into current agricultural uses, or not being needed by nonfarming owners. Fortunately, preservation associations have formed to save these barn structures. Join one today, because every year, hundreds of barns are taken down, the go</p></p><h2>The Great Gatsby</h2><p>WITH A NEW INTRODUCTION BY GEOFF DYERThe world and his mistress are at Jay Gatsby's party. But Gatsby stands apart from the crowd, isolated by a secret longing. In between sips of champagne his guests speculate about their mysterious host., Some say he's a bootlegger. Others swear he was a German spy during the war. They lean in and whisper `he killed a man once'., Just where is Gatsby from and what is the obsession that drives him?This edition of The Great Gatsby is the result of a unique collaboration between Tiffany &amp; Co. and Vintage Classics. It is based on designs in the Tiffany &amp;Co., archives from the twenties when F. Scott Fitzgerald's talent, beauty and notorious lifestyle made him one of best known writers of the Jazz Age.</p><p>In 1922, F Scott Fitzgerald announced his decision to write "something new--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple, intricately patterned". That extraordinary, beautiful, intricately patterned and, above all, simple novel became <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, arguably Fitzgerald's finest work and certainly the book for which he is best known. A portrait of the Jazz Age in all of its decadence and excess, Gatsby captured the spirit of the author's generation and earned itself a permanent place in American mythology. Self-made, self-invented millionaire Jay Gatsby embodies some of Fitzgerald's--and his country's--most abiding obsessions: money, ambition, greed and the promise of new beginnings. "Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning--" Gatsby's rise to glory and eventual fall from grace be comes a kind of cautionary tale about the American Dream.<p> It's also a love story, of sorts, the narrative of Gatsby's quixotic passion for Daisy Buchanan. The pair meet five years before the novel begins, when Daisy is a legendary young Louisville beauty and Gatsby an impoverished officer. They fall in love, but while Gatsby serves overseas, Daisy marries the brutal, bullying but extremely rich Tom Buchanan. After the war, Gatsby devotes himself blindly to the pursuit of wealth by whatever means--and to the pursuit of Daisy, which amounts to the same thing. "Her voice is full of money," Gatsby says admiringly, in one of the novel's more famous descriptions. His millions made, Gatsby buys a mansion across Long Island Sound from Daisy's patrician East Egg address, throws lavish parties and waits for her to appear. When s he does, events unfold with all the tragic inevitability of a Greek drama, with detached, cynical neighbour Nick Carraway acting as chorus throughout. Spare, elegantly plotted and written in crystalline prose, <i>The Great Gatsby</i> is as perfectly satisfying as the best kind of poem. <i>Perry Freeman, Amazon.com</i></p>"It&#x2019;s an absolute gem and stands head and shoulders above the others. With its thick creamy pages and gorgeous black, gold and mint green cover design inspired by pieces from the Tiffany archive, not only is it a pleasure to hold but for once it delivers on the publisher&#x2019;s promise to &#x201c;evoke the beauty and romance, glamour and luxury of the Roaring Twenties depicted in the novel"" (<i>Evening Standard</i>)<br><br>"<i>The Great Gatsby</i> remains not just one of the greatest works of American literature, but a timeless evocation of the allure, corruption and carelessness of wealth...a gilded society intoxicated by wealth, dancing its way into the Great Depression." (<i>The Times</i>)<br><br>"<i>Gatsby</i> is a connoisseur's guide to the glamour and glitter of the Jazz Age, but it's also a nearly prophetic glimpse into the world to come. Writing at the height of the boom, in the midst of the Roaring Twenties, Fitzgerald detected the ephemerality, fakery and corruption always lurking at the heart of the great American success story... A haunting meditation on aspiration, disillusionment, romantic love - and a blistering expos� of the materialism, duplicity, and sexual politics driving what Fitzgerald calls America's true "business": "the service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty"" (<i>The Times</i>)<br><br>"It is a marvellously suggestive novel...a parable of modern America, and by extension of modern life" (<i>Daily Telegraph</i>)<br><br>"The first and greatest modern novel, it has beautiful women, lavish parties, romance, betrayal and murder woven together in an intricately structured plot. A prescient comment on the dying days of a gilded age that is brilliant entertainment with a very eloquent insight" (<i>Mirror</i>)</p><h2>Beachcomber</h2><p>Taking the summer off from her high-stress advertising job, Bonnie travels to a cozy Carolina beach where she falls for a handsome drifter and begins enjoying her time off, but when she realizes that the women in a string of killings bear her resemblance, she fears she may be next.</p><p><b>Karen Robards</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of more than twenty novels, including <i>Beachcomber, Whispers at Midnight, Paradise County, Scandalous,</i> and <i>Irresistible.</i> Her short fiction was featured in Pocket Books' romantic-suspense anthology <i>Wait Until Dark.</i> She lives in Louisville, Kentucky, with her husband, Doug, and their three sons.<p><b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> <i>Two weeks later...</i> </p><p><br> Sometimes in life, when one thing goes wrong it triggers another and another until disasters end up multiplying around you like horny rabbits. Unfortunately, Christy Petrino was getting the nasty suspicion that this just might be one of those times. </p><p> She was being followed as she walked along the moonlit beach. She knew it. Knew it with a certainty that made her heart pound and her breathing quicken and the tiny hairs on the back of her neck prickle to attention. <i>Someone was behind her.</i> She felt eyes on her, hostility directed at her, the intangible vibes of another presence, with a sense that was more trustworthy yet less dependably there than the usual five. Tonight, as it typically did when it hit her, this sixth sense of hers made a mockery of sight and sound, smell, touch, and taste. She'd learned in a hard school to trust it implicitly. </p><p> <i>Please, God...</i>Fear curled inside her quicker than a coiling snake. Like any other good Catholic girl trembling on the brink of danger, she turned to a higher power for help even though it had been an embarrassingly long time since she had actually been inside a church. Hopefully, God wasn't keeping score. </p><p> <i>I'll go to Mass this Sunday, I swear. I mean, I promise. Just let this be my imagination.</i> </p><p> Clutching the slender can of Mace that was her next line of defense against the dangers that lurked in the night, she did her best to dismiss what her sixth sense was telling her even as she brought her other five senses to bear. The rush and hiss of the ocean as it lapped practically at her feet filled her ears. It drowned out all other sounds, not that it was likely that she would have heard any pursuing footsteps anyway, given the sound-deadening properties of the beach, she realized as her own steps faltered. Casting a compulsive glance over her shoulder, she saw nothing behind her but an empty seascape barely illuminated by dusky moonlight. Considering that it was after one in the morning and a drenching summer squall had done its bit to add to the suffocating humidity only an hour or so earlier, the fact that there was absolutely no one around could not be considered sinister: the family types that populated this particular stretch of Ocracoke's ocean frontage during August were doubtless all sound asleep inside their snug summer cottages. Except for those darkened cottages, set well back from the beach and barely visible over the rolling dunes, there was nothing to see but the lighthouse in the distance, willowy sea oats blowing in the rising wind that pushed a rippling line of whitecaps toward shore, and the pale narrow curve of the beach itself as it crooked like a bent finger out into the midnight blue of the Atlantic. </p><p> She was alone. <i>Of course</i> she was alone. </p><p> Letting out a sigh of relief, she cast her eyes skyward. <i>Thank you, God. I'll be there front row center on Sunday, I sw -- promise.</i> </p><p> Then her pesky sixth sense reared its unwelcome head again. </p><p> "Are you being paranoid or what?" Christy muttered the question aloud. But accusing herself of paranoia didn't help. She started walking back to the house with -- okay, she'd admit it -- mounting fear. </p><p> She didn't like being afraid. Being afraid ticked her off. Growing up in Atlantic City, New Jersey, on the wrong side of I-5 in the less-than-aptly named neighborhood of Pleasantville, she'd learned early on that if you showed fear you were liable to get your butt kicked, or worse. A girl whose father was dead and whose mother worked all day and partied all night had to be able to take care of herself -- and, in Christy's case, her two little sisters as well. She'd learned to be tough and she'd learned to be confident in her ability to handle anything life threw her way. Now, at twenty-seven, she was five feet seven inches tall, rendered fashionably slim and fit by dint of much effort, with medium brown hair that just brushed her shoulders, cocoa brown eyes, and a face that wasn't exactly beautiful but wouldn't send grown men screaming for the exits either. She was, in other words, all grown up, a lawyer -- of all unbelievable things -- with a life that until three days ago had been as close to perfect as she could make it. </p><p> Now it was blown to smithereens. And she was afraid. </p><p> "Wimp," she said under her breath as she walked on. There was nothing -- well, probably nothing -- to be afraid of. After all, she'd done what they wanted. She'd come here to the beach house on Ocracoke and stayed put, waiting for a phone call. When the call had finally come half an hour ago, she'd done exactly as she'd been told: take the briefcase down the beach to the Crosswinds Hotel and put it in the backseat of a gray Maxima parked by the pool. What was in the briefcase she didn't know. Didn't want to know. All she wanted to do was get rid of it, which she had just done. In doing so, she'd purchased the keys to her prison. </p><p> It was over. She was free. </p><p> God, she hoped so. The truth was, if she was really, really lucky, and said her rosary fifteen times and buried a statue of St. Jude, patron saint of impossible causes, upside down in the surf, then maybe she would be free. </p><p> Or maybe not. </p><p> So call her a pessimist. Some people got visited by the blue bird of happiness. The bird that fluttered periodically through her life was more like the gray bird of doubt. Doubt that sunshine and roses were ever going to be a permanent fixture in the life of Christina Marie Petrino. Doubt that a pink Caddy with Happily Ever After written on it was ever going to pull into her own personal parking space. It was that doubt that kept suspicion percolating through her brain now, that made her imagine bogeymen in the shadows and threats in the whisper of the wind as she trudged back along the beach. </p><p> They had no reason to come after her. She had done nothing to them. </p><p> Except know too much. </p><p> Despite the humid warmth of the night, Christy shivered. </p><p> "Do this one thing for me," Uncle Vince had said. Remembering how she had been intercepted on the way to her mother's house and pushed into the backseat of a car where he'd been waiting, she swallowed. For the first time in her life, she'd been afraid of Uncle Vince, who'd been her mother's off-and-on boyfriend for the last fifteen years. Christy hadn't grown up in Pleasantville for nothing. She recognized a threat when she heard it. Uncle Vince had been a made man when Tony Soprano had been no more than a gleam in his daddy's eye, and his "request" had been on the order of one of those offers you didn't want to refuse. </p><p> But now she'd done what he'd asked, she reminded herself, walking faster now, in a hurry to get back inside the house even though she was (almost) sure there was no real reason to do what her instincts were screaming at her to do and get the heck off the beach. She'd delivered the briefcase. They knew now that she was loyal, that she wasn't going to go running to anybody, much less the cops. So she'd quit her job. Big deal. People did it all the time. So she'd said buh-bye to her fianc�. People did that, too. All over the world, employees quit and engaged couples broke up and nobody died. Just because Michael DePalma, who had been her boss at the up-and-coming Philadelphia law firm of DePalma and Lowery as well as her fianc�, had said <i>Don't you know you can't quit? After what Franky told you, do you really think they're going to let you just walk away?</i> did not mean that she was now first in line to get whacked. </p><p> Did it? </p><p> Maybe Uncle Vince, or somebody else, had decided that something more was needed in the way of ensuring her continued silence. Something permanent. Because she could still feel someone behind her in the dark. Watching her. Waiting. The picture that popped into her mind was of a hunter carefully stalking his prey. </p><p> The idea of herself as prey did nothing for Christy's blood pressure. </p><p> Drawing a deep breath, trying not to panic, Christy tightened her hold on the Mace can, and strained to identify shadowy shapes rendered spooky by darkness. <i>Oh God, what was that -- and that -- and that?</i> Her heart skipped a beat as she spotted possible threats. Only slowly did it resume a more even rhythm as she realized that the motionless rectangle that lay ahead of her that she'd first thought might be a man squatting in the surf was, on more careful inspection, a lounge chair left close by the water's edge; while the towering, swaying triangle -- a man's head and shoulders? -- rising menacingly over the top of a nearby dune was nothing more than a partially furled beach umbrella in its stand; and the round object -- someone hunkered down? -- just visible beside a patio fence was the protruding rear tire of a bicycle left trustingly outside. </p><p> Nothing but harmless, everyday, island-variety objects as far as the eye could see. As Christy told herself that, her alarm faded a little but refused to disappear entirely. The niggling sense of being watched, of another presence -- of <i>danger</i> -- was too strong to be routed by lack of visual confirmation. Wrapping her bare arms around herself, she continued to warily probe the darkness with every sense she could bring to bear. She stood very still, with the loose, ankle-length green gauze dress she had pulled on for her beach adventure blowing tight against her legs and her toes burrowing into the sand. Stars played peekaboo with drifting clouds overhead; a fingernail moon floated high in the black velvet sky; frothing with foam, waves slapped the sand, withdrew, and rolled in again, beach music with a never-ending rhythm that should have been comforting but under these disquieting circumstances was not. She listened and watched and breathed, tasting the salt tang on her lips as she wet them, smelling the briny ocean in the deep, lung-expanding breaths she deliberately drew in an effort to steady her jangled nerves. </p><p> "Okay, Christy, get a grip." Talking to herself was probably not a good sign. No, she realized glumly, it was <i>definitely</i> not a good sign. If she was getting a little crazy, she thought as she quickened her pace toward the small, single-story house that was now beckoning like an oasis, that should fall under the category of Just One More Big Surprise. She was up to her neck in disasters, and there was no telling where another one of those horny little rabbits was going to pop up next. Ordinarily she loved Ocracoke; she'd vacationed here at least half a dozen times in the past. Use of the beach house was an occasional perk of her mother's special friendship with Uncle Vince. But now this tiny beach community in North Carolina's Outer Banks was starting to feel like it had been ripped right out of the pages of a Stephen King novel. A vision of Blackbeard's ghost -- the notorious pirate was said to haunt Ocracoke's beaches, his severed head tucked under his arm -- shadowing her along the water's edge popped into her mind, raising goose bumps on her arms. Which was ridiculous, of course. Who believed in ghosts? Not she, but -- the phrase that kept running through her head was, <i>something wicked this way comes. </i></p><p><i> Dear God, I'll go to Mass every Sunday for the rest of my life if you'll just get me safely out of here.</i> </p><p> She had to calm down and think this through. </p><p> If someone truly was behind her, if this terrifying sense of a hostile presence stalking her through the night was not just a product of overabundant imagination and overwrought nerves, then, clearly, it behooved her to get the heck off the beach. If she ran, anyone who happened to be back there would know she was on to them. If she walked, anyone who happened to be back there just might catch up. </p><p> That was the clincher. Yanking her skirt clear of her knees, she ran. </p><p> The sand was warm and gritty underfoot, dotted with puddles and strewn here and there with webs of stringy seaweed. Moonlight glinted on the clear blob of a jellyfish as it came tumbling toward her, rolling along on the outer edges of the inrushing tide. Fighting bubbling panic, gasping for breath, her heart beating a hundred miles a minute, her straining legs only wishing they could pump as fast, she pushed everything from her mind but the urgent need to <i>get off that beach.</i> The sound of the surf effectively deafened her; blowing strands of her hair whipping in front of her face all but blinded her. She couldn't hear so much as the slap of her own feet hitting the beach; she could barely see where she was going. But she could <i>feel</i> -- and what she was feeling terrified her. </p><p> Her five senses be damned: at the moment only the sixth one mattered. And it was telling her that she was in imminent danger. There was someone behind her, giving chase -- hunting her. </p><p> In the very act of casting what must have been the dozenth in a series of frightened glances over her shoulder, Christy tripped over something and went down. </p><p> She hit hard. Her knees gouged twin pits in the sand. Her palms thudded and sank. Her teeth clinked together with a force that sent pain shooting through the joint that connected her jaws. Salt spray hit her in the face as a large wave broke with particular enthusiasm just yards away. </p><p> Stunned to have been so abruptly catapulted onto all fours, she registered all that in an instant. She'd tripped. What had she tripped over? A piece of driftwood? What? </p><p> <i>He's coming. Move.</i> </p><p> Heart leaping as her own personal early warning system went off in spades, Christy obeyed, scrambling to her feet and at the same time instinctively glancing back to see what had felled her. Not that it mattered. Whoever was out there was closing in fast. She could sense him behind her, almost feel him.... </p><p> A slender arm, inert and pale as the sand itself, lay inches behind her feet. Realizing just what had tripped her, Christy was momentarily shocked into immobility. Then her widening gaze followed the limb down to the back of a head covered with a tangle of long, wet-looking dark hair, narrow shoulders and waist and hips, rounded buttocks, long legs. A woman lay there, sprawled facedown in the sand. She was wet, naked as far as Christy could tell, with one arm stretched out across the beach as if she had been trying to crawl toward the safety of the houses. She didn't move, didn't make a sound, didn't appear to so much as breathe. </p><p> She looked dead. </p><p> Then her hand moved, slender fingers closing convulsively on sand, and her body tensed as if she were trying without success to propel herself forward. </p><p> "Help...please..." </p><p> Had Christy really heard the muttered words? Or had she just imagined them? The pounding surf coupled with the frantic beating of her own pulse in her ears was surely enough to block out even much louder sounds. But... </p><p> "I'm here," Christy said as she crouched, touching the back of the woman's hand with equal parts caution and concern. As her fingertips made contact with cold, sand-encrusted skin, a swift rush of pity tightened her throat. <i>Poor thing, poor thing...</i> </p><p> The woman's fingers twitched as if in acknowledgment of her touch. </p><p> "La...law..." </p><p> There was no mistake: she reall...</p></p><h2>A Spectacle of Corruption: A Novel</h2><p>Benjamin Weaver, the quick-witted pugilist turned private investigator, returns in David Liss&#x2019;s sequel to the Edgar Award&#x2013;winning novel, <b>A Conspiracy of Paper</b>.<br><br>Moments after his conviction for a murder he did not commit, at a trial presided over by a judge determined to find him guilty, Benjamin Weaver is accosted by a stranger who cunningly slips a lockpick and a file into his hands. In an instant he understands two things: Someone had gone to a great deal of trouble to see him condemned to hang&#x2014;and another equally mysterious agent is determined to see him free.<br><br>So begins <b>A Spectacle of Corruption</b>, which heralds the return of Benjamin Weaver, the hero of <b>A Conspiracy of Paper</b>. After a daring escape from eighteenth-century London&#x2019;s most notorious prison, Weaver must face another challenge: how to prove himself innocent of a crime when the corrupt courts have already shown they want only to see him hang. To discover the truth and clear his name, he will have to understand the motivations behind a secret scheme to extort a priest, uncover double-dealings in the unrest among London&#x2019;s dockworkers, and expose the conspiracy that links the plot against him to the looming national election&#x2014;an election with the potential to spark a revolution and topple the monarchy. <br><br>Unable to show his face in public, Weaver pursues his inquiry in the guise of a wealthy merchant who seeks to involve himself in the political scene. But he soon finds that the world of polite society and politics is filled with schemers and plotters, men who pursue riches and power&#x2014;and those who seek to return the son of the deposed king to the throne. Desperately navigating a labyrinth of politicians, crime lords, assassins, and spies, Weaver learns that, in an election year, little is what it seems and the truth comes at a staggeringly high cost.<br><br>Once again, acclaimed author David Liss combines historical erudition with mystery, complex characterization, and a captivating sense of humor. <b>A Spectacle of Corruption </b>offers insight into our own world of political scheming, and it firmly establishes David Liss as one of the best writers of intellectual suspense at work today.</p><p>"I sentence you, Mr. Weaver, to be hanged for the most horrible crime of murder." Hearing that judicial decree, Benjamin Weaver--former pugilist, current "thief-taker," and future master of disguise--begins one of the sorriest days of his life. And things will only get worse, as David Liss reveals in <i>A Spectacle of Corruption</i>, his exuberant novel of 18th-century political chicanery. Tossed into London&#x2019;s notorious Newgate Prison, Weaver employs his considerable energy and guile (plus tools slipped to him by a mysterious admirer at his trial) to escape--naked--into the city's filthy streets. But then, he risks recapture by trying to figure out who framed him for slaying labor agitator Walter Yate, and why.<p> How all of this trouble derived from Weaver's pursuit of the culprit behind a priest&#x2019;s recent spate of hate mail propels the balance of this yarn--the sequel to Liss's Edgar Award-winning debut novel, <i>A Conspiracy of Paper</i>. It also pushes the Jewish "ruffian-for-hire" into the jeopardous midst of a British power struggle that pits supporters of King George I against the Jacobites, who favor the return of his dethroned Catholic rival, James II. Assisted by his puckish surgeon friend Elias Gordon, Weaver assumes the role of a prosperous plantation owner from Jamaica and penetrates the upper echelons of 1722 London society, hoping to gather information he can use against Dennis Dogmill, a "vicious and unpredictable" tobacco man who may actually have ordained Yate's killing. As Weaver ranges through London's fetid pubs and fancy theaters, and attracts the amorous attention of Dogmill's surprisingly shrewd sister, he also finds himself in the uncomfortable position of backing Griffin Melbury, a Tory candidate for the House of Commons--and the man who stole away his beloved Miriam Lienzo.</p><p> Liss has a keen eye for entertaining details of Georgian life, from that period&#x2019;s exotic diction ("The men in your gang are nothing but cutpurses and mollies and buggerantos") to its most reprehensible pastimes, including "goose pulling"--about which the less said, the better. And though some readers may bog down in the explained distinctions between Whigs and Tories, the author finds considerable humor in that political rivalry and the parties' get-out-the-vote efforts. Once you accept the rather dubious notion that fugitive Weaver could hide in plain sight, <i>A Spectacle of Corruption</i> can be appreciated as the lusty thriller Liss clearly intended it to be. <i>--J.

Drawing on his own experiences of hunting, and offering a portrait of the people and animals who take part in it, Scruton introduces the reader to some of the mysteries of country life.</p><p>Roger Scruton lives in Wiltshire where he hunts with the Beaufort and Vale of White Horse. He is the author of over twenty books and is a well-known media personality. A knight-errant on behalf of forgotten truth, he has espoused every cause deemed lost by mad modernity."My life divides into three parts," philosopher-journalist Scruton says. "In the first I was wretched; in the second ill at ease; in the third hunting." He wasn't born to the hunt. His parents were industrial Midlanders, and his ardent Labourite father, despairing of his son's class loyalties when his scion was admitted to a grammar school with public school pretensions, was partly mollified only when Roger "skived off sports, . . . opt[ed] out of cadets, and was generally . . . unhappy and insolent." He discovered hunting accidentally, when out riding a generally docile horse owned by a colleague. A foxhunt passed by and, after standing a while mesmerized by it, the old steed took off to join it and proved to be "a 'front-runner,' a horse determined to be first in the herd." Scruton was hooked and has been hunting ever since for a complex of reasons he lays out, explains, and proselytizes in this thoroughly delightful essay that is not without its depths of patriotic feeling, interspecies fellowship, small-c conservative sentiment--and bone-wrenching unsaddlings. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Reading these portraits of Church Fathers, one is struck by how their minds and hearts were aflame with love for Christ Jesus as revealed in Scripture. To love God and neighbor in Christ and his Spirit &#x2014; this is the quest to which these extraordinary people dedicated their lives.

He was astonishingly prolific until his untimely death at age fifty-nine, writing some dozen major books, all marked by breathtaking erudition and a provocative essayistic style. He single-handedly rehabilitated Nietzsche&#x2019;s reputation after World War II and was enormously influential in introducing postwar American readers to existentialism. Until now, no book has examined his intellectual legacy.</p><p>Stanley Corngold provides the first in-depth study of Kaufmann&#x2019;s thought, covering all his major works. He shows how Kaufmann speaks to many issues that concern us today, such as the good of philosophy, the effects of religion, the persistence of tragedy, and the crisis of the humanities in an age of technology. Few scholars in modern times can match Kaufmann&#x2019;s range of interests, from philosophy and literature to intellectual history and comparative religion, from psychology and photography to art and architecture. Corngold provides a heartfelt portrait of a man who, to an extraordinary extent, transfigured his personal experience in the pages of his books.</p><p>This original study, both appreciative and critical, is the definitive intellectual life of one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most engaging yet neglected thinkers. It will introduce Kaufmann to a new generation of readers and serves as a fitting tribute to a scholar&#x2019;s incomparable <i>libido sciendi</i>, or lust for knowledge.</p></p><p><b>Stanley Corngold</b> is professor emeritus of German and comparative literature at Princeton University.

Later it was said that both had fallen ill: the truth is different. The real story starts much earlier, in 1961, with the birth of Nombeko Mayeki in a shack in Soweto. Nombeko was fated to grow up fast and die early in her poverty-stricken township. But Nombeko takes a different path. She finds work as a housecleaner and eventually makes her way up to the position of chief advisor, at the helm of one of the world's most secret projects.</p><p>Here is where the story merges with, then diverges from reality. South Africa developed six nuclear missiles in the 1980s, then voluntarily dismantled them in 1994. This is a story about the seventh missile . . . the one that was never supposed to have existed. Nombeko Mayeki knows too much about it, and now she's on the run from both the South African justice and the most terrifying secret service in the world. She ends up in Sweden, which has transformed into a nuclear nation, and the fate of the world now lies in Nombeko's hands.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>A wildly picaresque new novel from Jonas Jonasson, the author of the internationally bestselling <em>The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared</em></p><p>In a tiny shack in the largest township in South Africa, Nombeko Mayeki is born. Put to work at five years old and orphaned at ten, she quickly learns that the world expects nothing more from her than to die young, be it from drugs, alcohol, or just plain despair. But Nombeko has grander plans. She learns to read and write, and at just fifteen, using her cunning and fearlessness, she makes it out of Soweto with millions of smuggled diamonds in her possession. Then things take a turn for the worse.... </p><p>Nombeko ends up the prisoner of an incompetent engineer in a research facility working on South Africa's secret nuclear arsenal. Yet the unstoppable Nombeko pulls off a daring escape to Sweden, where she meets twins named Holger One and Holger Two, who are carrying out a mission to bring down the Swedish monarchy...by any means necessary. </p><p>Nombeko's life ends up hopelessly intertwined with the lives of the twins, and when the twins arrange to kidnap the Swedish king and prime minister, it is up to our unlikely heroine to save the day&#x2014;and possibly the world. In this wild romp, Jonasson tackles issues ranging from the pervasiveness of racism to the dangers of absolute power while telling a charming and hilarious story along the way. In the satirical voice that has earned him legions of fans the world over, Jonasson gives us another rollicking tale of how even the smallest of decisions can have sweeping&#x2014;even global&#x2014;consequences.</p><p>Jonas Jonasson was a journalist for the <em>Expressen</em> newspaper for many years.

With prose of characteristic precision, Ballard movingly recalls his first attempts at science fiction, the 1970 American pulping of <em>The Atrocity Exhibition</em>&#x2015;which sprang from his fascination with JFK conspiracy theories&#x2015;and his life as a single father after the premature death of his wife. &#x201c;This book should make yet more converts to a cause that Ballard&#x2019;s devotees have been pleading for years&#x201d; (<em>Independent</em>). 12 illustrations</p><p>J.G. Ballard was born in Shanghai in 1930 and lived in England from 1946 until his death in London in 2009. He is the author of nineteen novels, including Empire of the Sun, The Drought, and Crash, with many of them made into major films.&#x201c;The unpredictably serene memoir from one of the most daring voices in fiction.... An affectionate... recollection of life&#x2019;s rich pageant.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Warmer, plainer and more elegiac than his admirers may have foreseen... What&#x2019;s largely new, and savage, in this memoir is the level of disillusionment Ballard came to feel during the war, about both England and his own distant parents... I&#x2019;m not sure I&#x2019;ve read a more comprehensive takedown of the postwar British psyche... Beneath Ballard&#x2019;s inherently critical mind, and in contrast to the alienation that permeates his fiction, <em>Miracles of Life</em> slowly unfolds into a rather big-hearted book about family and child rearing... I read it with deep interest as critic and father.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Dwight Garner, <em>New York Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Warm,&#x2019; &#x2018;poignant&#x2019; and &#x2018;loving&#x2019; aren&#x2019;t adjectives you&#x2019;d readily apply to the work of British novelist J.G. Ballard (1930-2009). But in his memoir...those adjectives are what come to mind ... albeit with some subversive, complicating twists...That sense of sabotaged realities permeates all his fiction, from <em>The Drowned World</em> (1952) to his final novel, <em>Kingdom Come</em> (2006). <em>Miracles of Life</em>, along with telling his own powerful personal story, casts light on where his unique vision came from.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michael Upchurch, <em>Seattle Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Though the book has all the discursiveness one might expect from a memoir written by a man facing down death, there&#x2019;s still a sharpness to Ballard&#x2019;s sense of humor, particularly when it comes to his interactions with Hollywood (he calls Holly Hunter&#x2019;s press conference defense of the movie <em>Crash</em> the best performance at Cannes). He remained, to the end, a gimlet-eyed bard.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jonathan Messinger, <em>Time Out Chicago</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;With the same restraint and lucidity that defined so much of his fiction, <em>Miracles of Life</em> makes the case for viewing the work through the prism of the life, and indeed for deciphering the writings as a kind of post-traumatic eternal return... In the book&#x2019;s most vivid passages, 1930s Shanghai comes to life as a playground for the budding surrealist.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Dennis Lim, <em>Bookforum</em></strong></p><h2>Spore (Star Wars: Galaxy of Fear, Book 9)</h2><p>Tash, Zak, and Uncle Hoole stop on the planet Ithor for supplies, including a mineral the Shroud needs for its engines.

The journey to the colony is filled with many dangers. But nothing prepares Hoole, Tash, and Zak for what they meet when they reach their destination.

Expensive, heavy, and fashioned from the finest uncoated paper and soy-based ink, this thigh-crushing book is certain to cut off the circulation of all but the most active of comics boosters.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no writer alive whose work I love more than Chris Ware.

NPR host Ira Glass, who provides the preface, got him out of the house a few years ago, Ware writes, and the exposure helped him become better known to readers, but it wasn&#x2019;t as if he was a hermit. He worked as a newspaper cartoonist, a graphic artist, an illustrator, and, as he writes, learned on the job to be a social being and to pay attention to deadlines and requirements, all good things for a budding artist to know. <b>Throughout, Ware peppers his narrative with other lessons he&#x2019;s learned along the way: about technique, the history of art, the links between cartoons and cinema, and yes, about life, aging, and so forth</b>; it&#x2019;s good to change your horizons and see the world, as he reckons, because &#x201c;artists don&#x2019;t develop in a vacuum.&#x201d; The oversized book is overstuffed with art, <b>each page spread containing numerous images, cartoon strips, sketches, mockups, snapshots, scrapbook items, and other such treasures that will be of immense appeal to fans of Krazy Kat and Joseph Cornell alike</b>.

For her and for this house, he would spare no expense and overlook no detail, from the endless marble floors to the glittering chandeliers. Almost a century later, with the once-grand house now in disrepair, a young woman walks through its empty rooms. Sarah Anderson, a perfectly sensible estate lawyer, is about to do something utterly out of character. An elderly client has died and left her two gifts. One is a generous inheritance. The other, a priceless message: to use his money for something wonderful, something daring. And in this old house, surrounded by crumbling grandeur, Sarah knows just what it is.<br> <br> A respected attorney and self-described workaholic, Sarah had always lived life by the book. With a steady, if sputtering, relationship and a tiny apartment that has suited her just fine, Sarah cannot explain the force that draws her to the mansion and its history&#x2013;to the story of a woman who once lived in the house, then mysteriously left it, to a child who grew up there, and a drama that unfolded in war-torn France...and to a history she never knew she had. <br> <br> Taking the biggest risk of her life, Sarah enlists the help of architect Jeff Parker, who shares Sarah&#x2019;s passion for bringing the exquisite old house back to life.

She hurried out of the building at One Market Plaza, stepped off the curb, and hailed a cab. It occurred to her, as it always did, that one of these days when she met with him, it would really be for the last time. He always said it was. She had begun to expect him to live forever, despite his protests, and in spite of the realities of time. Her law firm had handled his affairs for more than half a century. She had been his estate and tax attorney for the past three years. At thirty-eight, Sarah had been a partner of the firm for the past two years, and had inherited Stanley as a client when his previous attorney died.<br> <br> Stanley had outlived them all. He was ninety-eight years old. It was hard to believe sometimes. His mind was as sharp as it had ever been, he read voraciously, and he was well aware of every nuance and change in the current tax laws. He was a challenging and entertaining client. Stanley Perlman had been a genius in business all his life. The only thing that had changed over the years was that his body had betrayed him, but never once his mind. He was bedridden now, and had been for nearly seven years. Five nurses attended to him, three regularly in eight-hour shifts, two as relief. He was comfortable, most of the time, and hadn't left his house in years. Sarah had always liked and admired him, although others thought he was irascible and cantankerous. She thought he was a remarkable man. She gave the cabdriver Stanley's Scott Street address. They made their way through the downtown traffic in San Francisco's financial district, and headed west uptown, toward Pacific Heights, where he had lived in the same house for seventy-six years.<br> <br> The sun was shining brightly as they climbed Nob Hill up California Street, and she knew it might be otherwise when they got uptown. The fog often sat heavily on the residential part of the city, even when it was warm and sunny downtown. Tourists were happily hanging off the cable car, smiling as they looked around. Sarah was bringing Stanley some papers to sign, nothing extraordinary. He was always making minor additions and adjustments to his will. He had been prepared to die for all the years she had known him, and long before. But in spite of that, whenever he seemed to take a turn for the worse, or suffered from a brief illness, he always rallied and hung on, much to his chagrin. He had told her only that morning, when she called to confirm her appointment with him, that he had been feeling poorly for the last few weeks, and it wouldn't be long.<br> <br> "Stop threatening me, Stanley," she had said, putting the last of the papers for him in her briefcase. "You're going to outlive us all."<br> <br> She was sad for him at times, although there was nothing depressing about him, and he rarely felt sorry for himself. He still barked orders at his nurses, read The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal daily, as well as the local papers, loved pastrami sandwiches and hamburgers, and spoke with fascinating accuracy and historical detail about his years growing up on the Lower East Side of New York. He had come to San Francisco at sixteen, in 1924. He had been remarkably clever at finding jobs, making deals, working for the right people, seizing opportunities, and saving money. He had bought property, always in unusual circumstances, sometimes preying on others' misfortunes, he readily admitted, and making trades, and using whatever credit was available to him. He had managed to make money while others were losing it during the Depression. He was the epitome of a self-made man.<br> <br> He liked to say that he had bought the house he lived in for "pennies" in 1930. And considerably later, he had been among the first to build shopping malls in Southern California. Most of his early money had been made in real estate development, trading one building for another, sometimes buying land no one else wanted, and biding his time to either sell it later or build office buildings or shopping centers on it. He had had the same intuitive knack later on, for investing in oil wells. The fortune he had amassed was literally staggering by now. Stanley had been a genius in business, but had done little else in his life. He had no children, had never married, had no contact with anyone but attorneys and nurses. There was no one who cared about Stanley Perlman, except his young attorney, Sarah Anderson, and no one who would miss him when he died, except the nurses he employed. The nineteen heirs listed in the will that Sarah was once again updating for him (this time to include a series of oil wells he had just purchased in Orange County, after selling off several others, once again at the right time) were great-nieces and -nephews he had never met or corresponded with, and two elderly cousins who were nearly as old as he was, and whom he said he hadn't seen since the late forties but felt some vague attachment to. In truth, he was attached to no one, and made no bones about it. He had had one mission throughout his lifetime, and one only, and that had been making money. He had achieved his goal. He said he had been in love with two women in his younger days, but had never offered to marry either and had lost contact with both of them when they gave up on him and married other men, more than sixty years ago.<br> <br> The only thing he said he regretted was not having children. He thought of Sarah as the grandchild he had never had, but might have, if he had taken the time to get married. She was the kind of granddaughter he would have liked to have. She was smart, funny, interesting, quick, beautiful, and good at what she did. Sometimes, when she brought papers to him, he loved to sit and look at her and talk to her for hours. He even held her hand, something he never did with his nurses. They got on his nerves and annoyed him, patronized him, and fussed over him in ways he hated. Sarah never did. She sat there looking young and beautiful, while speaking to him of the things that interested him. She always knew her stuff about new tax laws. He loved the fact that she came up with new ideas about how to save him money. He had been wary of her at first, because of her youth, and then progressively came to trust her, in the course of her visits to his small musty room in the attic of the house on Scott Street. She came up the back stairs, carrying her briefcase, entered his room discreetly, sat on a chair next to his bed, and they talked until she could see he was exhausted. Each time she came to see him, she feared it would be the last time. And then he would call her with some new idea, some new plan that had occurred to him, something he wanted to buy, sell, acquire, or dispose of. And whatever he touched always increased his fortune. Even at ninety-eight, Stanley Perlman had a Midas touch when it came to money. And best of all, despite the vast difference in their ages, over the years she'd worked with him, Sarah and Stanley had become friends.<br> <br> Sarah glanced out the window of the cab as they passed Grace Cathedral, at the top of Nob Hill, and sat back against the seat, thinking about him. She wondered if he really was sick, and if it might be the last time. He had had pneumonia twice the previous spring and each time, miraculously, survived it. Maybe now he wouldn't. His nurses were diligent in their care of him, but sooner or later, at his age, something was going to get him. It was inevitable, although Sarah dreaded it. She knew she'd miss him terribly when he was gone.<br> <br> Her long dark hair was pulled neatly back, her eyes were big and almost cornflower blue. He had commented on them the first time he saw her, and asked if she wore colored contact lenses. She had laughed at the question and assured him she didn't. Her usually creamy skin was tan this time, after several weekends in Lake Tahoe. She liked to hike and swim, and ride a mountain bike. Weekends away were always a relief after the long hours she spent in her office. Her partnership in the law firm had been well earned. She had graduated from Stanford law school, magna cum laude, and was a native San Franciscan. She had lived here all her life, except for the four years she spent as an undergraduate at Harvard. Her credentials and hard work had impressed Stanley and her partners. Stanley had grilled her extensively when they met, and had commented that she looked more like a model. She was tall, thin, athletic looking, and had long legs that he always silently admired. She was wearing a neat navy blue suit, which was the kind of thing she always wore when she visited him. The only jewelry she wore was a pair of small diamond earrings that had been a Christmas gift from Stanley. He had ordered them by phone for her himself from Neiman Marcus. He was not usually generous, he preferred to give his nurses money on holidays, but he had a soft spot for Sarah, just as she had for him. She had given him several cashmere throws to keep him warm. His house always seemed cold and damp. He scolded the nurses soundly whenever they put the heat on. Stanley preferred to use a blanket than be what he thought of as careless with his money.<br> <br> Sarah had always been intrigued by the fact that he had never occupied the main part of the house, only the old servants' rooms in the attic. He said he had bought the place as an investment, had always meant to sell it, and never had. He had kept the house more out of laziness than any deep affection for it. It was a large, beautiful, once-luxurious home that had been built in the twenties. Stanley had told her that the family that had built it had fallen on hard times after the Crash of '29, and he had bought it in 1930. He had moved into one of the old maids' rooms then, with an old brass bed, a chest of drawers the original owners had abandoned there, and a chair whose springs had died so long ago that sitting on it was like resting on concrete. The brass bed had been replaced by a hospital bed a decade before. There was an old photograph of the fire after the earthquake on the wall, and not a single photograph of a person anywhere in his room. There had been no people in his life, only investments, and attorneys. There was nothing personal anywhere in the house. The furniture had all been sold separately at auction by the original owners, also for nearly nothing. And Stanley had never bothered to furnish it when he moved in. He had told her that the house had been stripped bare before he got it. The rooms were large and once elegant, there were curtains hanging in shreds at some of the windows. Others were boarded up, so the curious couldn't look in. And although she'd never seen it, Sarah had been told there was a ballroom. She had never walked around the house, but came in straight from the service door, up the back stairs, to his attic bedroom. Her only purpose in coming here was to see Stanley. She had no reason to tour the house, except that she knew that one day, more than likely, after he was gone, she would have to sell it. All of his heirs were in Florida, New York, or the Midwest, and none of them would have an interest in owning an enormous white elephant of a house in California. No matter how beautiful it had once been, none of them would have any use for it, just as Stanley hadn't. It was hard to believe he had lived in it for seventy-six years and neither furnished it nor moved from the attic. But that was Stanley. Eccentric perhaps, unassuming, unpretentious, and a devoted and respected client. Sarah Anderson was his only friend. The rest of the world had forgotten he existed. And whatever friends he had once had, he had long since outlived them.<br> <br> The cab stopped at the address on Scott Street that Sarah had given the driver. She paid the fare, picked up her briefcase, got out of the cab, and rang the back doorbell. As she had expected, it was noticeably colder and foggy out here, and she shivered in her light jacket. She was wearing a thin white sweater under the dark blue suit, and looked businesslike, as she always did, when the nurse opened the door and smiled when she saw her. It took them forever to come downstairs from the attic. There were four floors and a basement, Sarah knew, and the elderly nurses who tended to him moved slowly. The one who opened the door to Sarah was relatively new, but she had seen Sarah before.<br> <br> "Mr. Perlman is expecting you," she said politely, as she stood aside to let Sarah in, and closed the door behind her.<br> <br> They only used the service door, as it was more convenient to the back staircase which led up to the attic. The front door hadn't been touched for years, and was kept locked and bolted. The lights in the main part of the house were never turned on. The only lights that had shone in the house for years were those in the attic. They cooked in a small kitchen on the same floor that had once served as a pantry. The main kitchen, a piece of history now, was in the basement. It had old-fashioned iceboxes and a meat locker. In the old days the iceman had come, and brought in huge chunks of ice. The stove was a relic from the twenties, and Stanley hadn't worked it since at least the forties. It was a kitchen that had been meant to be run by a flock of cooks and servants, overseen by a housekeeper and butler. It had nothing to do with Stanley's way of life. For years, he had come home with sandwiches and take-out food from diners and simple restaurants. He never cooked for himself, and went out every morning for breakfast in previous years before he as bedridden. The house was a place where he slept in the spartan brass bed, showered and shaved in the morning, and then went downtown to the office he had, to make more money. He rarely came home before ten o'clock at night. Sometimes as late as midnight. He had no reason to rush home.</p><h2>Companion to A Sand County Almanac: Interpretive and Critical Essays</h2><p>The first sustained study of Leopold&#39;s seminal book as well as a work of art, philosophy, and social commentary.</p><p>J. Baird Callicott is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Stevens Point.</p><h2>The Museum at Purgatory</h2><p>An illustrated novel set in purgatory brings the reader on a part visual, part narrative journey through the museum of the netherworld, narrated by a mysterious character named Non</p><p>Nick Bantock first burst onto the literary scene in 1991 with his remarkable illustrated novel <i>Griffin &amp; Sabine</i>--which was as much art as it was artifice. While chronicling the correspondence between two mysterious lovers, Bantock peppered his book with visual delights--macabre post cards, intricately designed stamps, exquisite envelopes that open to disclose hand-written letters. <i>Sabine's Notebook</i> and <i>The Golden Mean</i> soon followed to complete the trilogy. In many respects, <i>The Museum at Purgatory</i> resembles its predecessors, mixing metaphysics and art in a way meant to both puzzle and delight its readers. The narrator offers the basic premise early on: "My name is Non, and as Curator of the Museum here at Purgatory I am required by statute to facilitate, without judgment, the progress of all collectors assigned to these halls. It is my responsibility to act as their souls' guardian, as well as preserver of their accumulated treasures." Non then goes on to give a brief overview of the layout of Purgatory, a city that "takes a meditative, non-partisan view of reality" and where visitors are "faced with fundamental questions of self-worth" that must be resolved before they can move on. <p> In other words, this stopping place between heaven and hell is one big analyst's couch. Non's introduction to Purgatory scans like the overly formal, academic language one finds on informational panels in natural history museums--no doubt Bantock's intention. Unfortunately, this can become wearing after a while, and it isn't until the second half of the book when Non tells his own story (as opposed to the histories of the various "collections" under his care) that the prose loosens up somewhat. </p><p> But it's the illustrations that make Bantock's books special; it's unfortunate that several of them look as if they've escaped from a Dorling Kindersley guidebook--photographs of objects on stark backgrounds with a caption explaining their significance or use. Yet this museum contains some lovely examples of its author's art. As always, his stamps and postcards are exquisite--and how many cards are postmarked <i>Nirvana</i> or bear stamps from <i>Inferno</i>? This book may not equal the mystery or sheer beauty of the Griffin &amp; Sabine trilogy, but Nick Bantock fans will still find plenty to intrigue and amuse. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Artist and writer Nick Bantock is the author of the best-selling Griffin &amp; Sabine trilogy. <i> The Egyptian Jukebox, The Venetian's Wife,</i> and <i> The Forgetting Room.</i> He lives on an island in the Pacific Northwest.</p><h2>A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum Libretto (Applause Libretto Library)</h2><p>Book by Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart<br><br>Introduction by Larry Gelbart<br><br>&#x201c;This brazenly retro Broadway musical, inspired by Plautus, is as timeless as comedy itself.&#x201d; &#x2013;Vincent Canby, <i>The New York Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;The most urbane and literate musical comedy text ever conceived.&#x201d; &#x2013;John Simon, <i>New York</i> magazine</p><p>Stephen Sondheim made his name writing the lyrios of West Side Story and Gypsy, before going on to create Company, Follies, A Little Night Music, Pacific Overtures, Sweeney Todd, Sunday in the Park with George, Into the Woods, Assassins and Passion.

And tradition, to Boynton, is anything that happens every Christmas without fail: like trimming the tree, a fruitcake from the Rossiters, the crunch underfoot of your most precious ornament, and the customary search for scissors at four A.M. Christmas morning. <p> With guest appearances by Santa and his reindeer, Boynton's familiar menagerie reveals the many joys and satisfactions that make Chrismastime such a universally special season: the thrill of finding the right gift for someone you love, and affording it; the personal gratification of wrapping all the gifts early; and the wonder of Christmas morning, when you realize you forgot to label them. </p><p> And, in the spirit of giving, Boynton includes her own Christmas recipes: Santa's favorite chocolate chip cookies (with suggested note urging him to "please stack dishes neatly in the sink and wrap uneaten cookies in tin foil"); plum pudding (well worth someone else's time and money); and Wassail, which seems like a great treat if you happen to have 2,640 blanched almonds lying around the house.</p><p> This hardcover book makes a perfect gift for the "staunch traditionalist" and the "santaclaustrophobic" alike. 94,000 copies in print. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><p>What is surely the jolliest time of the year?

What is the most compelling occasion for the gathering together of family and friends to exult in a common spirit of joy and wonder and reverence and hope? <p> The answer, of course, is Super Bowl Sunday, but unfortunately Sandra Boynton knows very about football so she chose instead to write about Christmastime.</p><p>Sandra Boynton is a popular American cartoonist, writer, and songwriter.

Lacy ( Farther Afield ), gardening writer for the New York Times , has a vested interest: "to encourage fellow gardeners to pay attention to the neglected but glorious possibilities of the fall garden." Before reading more than a handful of pages, any floraphile will be feverishly taking notes on new plants and plant combinations to try, and eagerly awaiting the waning of the year. Rather than offer gardening advice for the whole U.S., Lacy sticks to what he knows: the plants that thrive in his region of southern New Jersey. But as he points out, in quoting Spanish philosopher Miguel de Unamuno, "the universal is the particular and the concrete, not the abstract or the general"--plenty of information here pertains to gardens in any climate. Lacy devotes a chapter each to lingering summer perennials, fall-flowering perennials, bulbs, grasses, annuals and woody plants. An epilogue describing blooms in December will have gardeners in higher latitudes sighing enviously. Included are an extensive list of nurseries, a bibliography and an index of plant names and nurseries. Photos not seen by PW.

This startling revision led some scientists to conclude that there are simply not enough human genes to account for all the different ways people behave: we must be made by nurture, not nature. Yet again biology was to be stretched on the Procrustean bed of the nature-nurture debate. Matt Ridley argues that the emerging truth is far more interesting than this myth. Nurture depends on genes, too, and genes need nurture. Genes not only predetermine the broad structure of the brain, they also absorb formative experiences, react to social cues, and even run memory. They are consequences as well as causes of the will.</p><p>Published fifty years after the discovery of the double helix of DNA, <em>Nature via Nurture </em>chronicles a revolution in our understanding of genes. Ridley recounts the hundred years' war between the partisans of nature and nurture to explain how this paradoxical creature, the human being, can be simultaneously free-willed and motivated by instinct and culture. <em>Nature via Nurture</em> is an enthralling,up-to-the-minute account of how genes build brains to absorb experience.</p></p><p>In the follow-up to his bestseller, <i>Genome</i>, Matt Ridley takes on a centuries-old question: is it nature or nurture that makes us who we are? Ridley asserts that the question itself is a "false dichotomy." Using copious examples from human and animal behavior, he presents the notion that our environment affects the way our genes express themselves. <p> Ridley writes that the switches controlling our 30,000 or so genes not only form the structures of our brains but do so in such a way as to cue off the outside environment in a tidy feedback loop of body and behavior. In fact, it seems clear that we have genetic "thermostats" that are turned up and down by environmental factors. He challenges both scientific and folk concepts, from assumptions of what's malleable in a person to sociobiological theories based solely on the "selfish gene." </p><p> Ridley's proof is in the pudding for such touchy subjects as monogamy, aggression, and parenting, which we now understand have some genetic controls. Nevertheless, "the more we understand both our genes and our instincts, the less inevitable they seem." A consummate popularizer of science, Ridley once again provides a perfect mix of history, genetics, and sociology for readers hungry to understand the implications of the human genome sequence. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p><p>Matt Ridley is the award-winning, bestselling author of several books, including&nbsp;<em>The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves</em>; <em>Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters</em>; and <em>The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature</em>.

Reprint.</p><p><b>Roger Zelazny</b>&nbsp;burst onto the SF scene in the early 1960s with a series of dazzling and groundbreaking short stories. He won his first of six Hugo Awards for Lord of Light, and soon after produced the first book of his enormously popular Amber series,&nbsp;<i>Nine Princes in Amber</i>. In addition to his Hugos, he went on to win three Nebula Awards over the course of a long and distinguished career. He died on June 14, 1995.On the face of it, this collaborative novel sounds perfect: Zelazny has always had one of the most inventive imaginations in the genre, and in his prime Sheckley was a brilliant humorist and one of sf's finest short-story writers. But Zelazny has been indulging himself in his lucrative but tired Amber series for the past few years, and Sheckley's recent work has shown little of his former panache. This joint effort has moments that recall the best of Zelazny and Sheckley, but like most of their recent solo work, it lacks depth. Azzie, an ambitious demon, decides to advance his career of wrongdoing by entering the Millennial competition between the Forces of Light and Dark for control of mankind's destiny. Azzie plans to stage a classic fairy-tale quest, sending a handsome prince out to rescue an enchanted princess with a kiss, but by judiciously preparing the players, Azzie expects it to end badly, thus proving that given free rein evil will win out in the human spirit. Azzie's preparations occupy most of the book, and we meet a hunchbacked servant, an alluring witch, a dim-witted dwarf, an aged dragon, and other unlikely creatures by the bushelful. The fast-moving story is dotted with moments of good fun and good gags, but most often it is merely amusing, and many of the jokes have been done better elsewhere. A pleasant diversion and some laughs, but this collaboration is not the equal of either author's best work. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Born in Chicago, he attended Northwestern University and upon graduation went to work for the Associated Press, beginning a lifelong career in journalism that would include long periods at the&nbsp;<i>Chicago Tribune</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Advertising Age</i>.<br> While at the&nbsp;<i>Tribune</i>, Goldsborough began writing mysteries in the voice of Rex Stout, the creator of iconic sleuths Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin. Goldsborough&#x2019;s first novel starring Wolfe,&nbsp;<i>Murder in E Minor</i>&nbsp;(1986), was met with acclaim from both critics and devoted fans, winning a Nero Award from the Wolfe Pack. Nine more Wolfe mysteries followed, including&nbsp;<i>Death on Deadline&nbsp;</i>(1987) and&nbsp;<i>Fade to Black</i>&nbsp;(1990). <i>Stop the Presses!</i>&nbsp;(2016) is his most recent novel. &nbsp;When not satisfying his gourmet palate, Super Sleuth Nero Wolfe is solving a case of murder in the Silver Spire, a Staten Island ministry. This whodunit is not one of twists and turns of plot, but one of good, well-rounded characters. For the most part, reader Michael Murphy gives a good performance. Initially, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish among characters&#39; voices. Some good jazz is interjected at the chapter breaks.

Reissue.</p><p>This comprehensive and easily understood book traces the development of Kabbalistic thought from its early beginnings to the twentieth century and offers insights into the cosmic process and the concept of reincarnation. Kabbalah for the Layman includes a wide range of encounters with noted Kabbalists who give us information about their personal lives. This book also explains the simple truth about these exceptional Kabbalists without the dogma and suspicion that often surrounds this fascinating topic. Kabbalah for the Layman Volume One is indispensable for those people whose interest in Kabbalah is based on tapping into its spiritual significance in order to enhance self-knowledge. In contrast to ritual without reason, the book&#39;s contemporary approach to this most ancient of all sciences provides us with a fresh perspective of Judaism. This book promises to enrich our mundane, physical world and add purpose to our lives. Written by Rav Berg, a contemporary Kabbalist and current dean of The Kabbalah Centre, the book focuses on the understanding and use of Kabbalah as a tool for our spiritual growth. Rav Berg, who holds a doctorate in comparative religion, observes &#34; any approach to Judaism with a strictly traditional viewpoint based solely on established dogma all too often leaves people feeling spiritually unfulfilled. &#34; As mankind enters the Aquarian Age of spiritual awakening and heightened awareness, Rav Berg takes us from our familiar world of existence to a startling new view of our universe. The author blazes the Kabbalistic trail from the very beginnings of our universe and leads us to a deeper, more intuitive realization of our enormous potential for attaining understanding and spirituality.Into this Mysterious universe we are born, with no apparent set of instructions, no maps or equations, no signs or guideposts, nothing but our equally unfathomable instincts, intuitions, and reasoning abilities to tell us where we came from, why we are here and what we are supposed to do. What we do possess - perhaps the key to our survival as a species - is an almost unquenchable need to know. A human being comes into this world with passionate sense of wonder and inquisitiveness and an equally an powerful need for self expression. Yet, somehow, these seemingly indelible primal imperatives become eroded, as a rule, after only a few years&#39; exposure to modern &#34;reality&#34; and contemporary educational methods.</p><h2>Only Time Will Tell (The Clifton Chronicles)</h2><p>A first installment of a planned five-part series introduces the character of 1920s Bristol dock worker Harry Clifton, whose unexpected scholarship leads him to pursue a very different life while uncovering the truth about his father&#39;s identity.

A dock worker in Bristol, Harry never knew his father and expects to continue on at the shipyard, until a remarkable gift wins him a scholarship to an exclusive boys' school, and his life will never be the same again...</p><p><b>"If there were a nobel prize for storytelling, Archer would win."</b><b>&#x2015;</b><b><i>Daily Telegraph</i></b><b> (London)</b></p><p>As Harry enters into adulthood, he finally learns how his father really died, but the awful truth only leads him to question: Was he even his father?

From the ravages of the Great War and the docks of working-class England to the streets of 1940 New York City and the outbreak of the Second World War, this is a powerful journey that will bring to life one hundred years of history to reveal a family story that neither the reader nor Harry Clifton himself could ever have imagined.</p><br><br><p><b>"Archer is a master entertainer."</b><b>&#x2015;<i>Time</i></b></p><b>JEFFREY ARCHER </b>was educated at Oxford University.

The poor brother was a servant in his rich brother&#x2019;s house. One day as he was standing guard at the gate, there came a tiny man wearing a golden cat and carrying a sack of gold on his shoulders.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; the poor brother asked.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m your brother&#x2019;s luck.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The poor brother was amazed. &#x201c;Perhaps you can tell me where I can find <i>my </i>luck?&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Of course I can, but it won&#x2019;t do you any good,&#x201d; said the tiny man. &#x201c;Because he&#x2019;s lying in a deserted field that&#x2019;s hard to find. And your luck is mangy and run down and asleep.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>But the poor brother begged and pleased and wept, until finally the man took pity on him. &#x201c;All right then, I&#x2019;ll tell you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Go off that way for a long, long time till you come to a field. Go past it for a long time till you come to another field, where you&#x2019;ll see thousands of lucks lying asleep. Don&#x2019;t wake them. Go on until you see thousands of other lucks who have just woken up. They will be sitting around yawning and scratching themselves, but don&#x2019;t let that bother you. Keep going, keep searching until you find a luck who&#x2019;s sleeping sounder than the others, and snoring louder. That one is your luck.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>And when the little man with the gold cap had finished speaking, he disappeared.<br>&nbsp;<br>Early the next morning the poor brother started off in search of his luck. He walked on and on until he came to a barren field, just as the little man had said. He didn&#x2019;t stop but went on until he came to another field that was equally barren. He looked about and saw a great many lucks sleeping and snoring, but he did not disturb them. He saw others who sat around yawning and scratching themselves, but he paid no attention.<br>&nbsp;<br>He went on and one, searching and searching, until he saw a luck That was sleeping more deeply than the others. He went up and tried to wake him: &#x201c;Luck, my luck, wake up. Why do you sleep so hard?&#x201d; His luck never stirred, just slept and snored. Again he tried to wake him, but nothing helped. Finally the poor man wept. &#x201c;Luck, ah my luck,&#x201d; he pleaded, &#x201c;don&#x2019;t sleep anymore. Pay attention. My wife and children are hungry. Help me. Give me something.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>His luck said nothing. But he put a scabby hand into his breast pocket, took out a silver gulden, and handed it to the poor man.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What good will this do?&#x201d; the man asked.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Some good, some good,&#x201d; grumbled the luck. &#x201c;Go to the marketplace and buy the first thing that comes your way.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The poor man went to the marketplace, where he met a peasant with a hen to sell. So he bought the hen and took it home. He went to sleep, and the hen flew up to a shelf and went to sleep too.<br>&nbsp;<br>When the poor man woke in the morning, he saw something gleaming on the shelf. He got out of bed and found that the hen had laid a golden egg. He woke his wife and children and showed them the golden egg, and they all danced and leaped for joy, Then the poor man took the egg and sold it for a great deal of money.

Ahtan seeks to bring all of humanity under his rule-destroying anything and anyone that stood in his path, including many friends and allies of young Prince Gaborn Val Orden. But Gaborn has fulfilled a two-thousand-year-old prophecy, becoming the Earth King-a mythic figure who can unleash the forces of the Earth itself. </p><p>And now the struggle continues. Gaborn has managed to drive off Raj Ahtan, but Ahtan is far from defeated. Striking at far-flung cities and fortresses and killing dedicates, Ahtan seeks to draw out the Earth King from his seat of power, to crush him. But as they weaken each other's forces in battle, the armies of an ancient and implacable inhuman enemy issue forth from the very bowels of the Earth.</p></p><p>David Farland's "Runelords" fantasy sequence began in 1998 with <i>The Sum of All Men</i>, a career-relaunch novel whose sales far outstripped earlier SF published under his real name Dave Wolverton. Runelords are supermen whose strength, stamina, and vision, and other physical abilities are multiplied by magical "endowments" transferred from unfortunate donors who are crippled by their loss: the archvillain in the story is virtually invincible thanks to tens of thousands of endowments. <p>This second book avoids middle-volume doldrums by introducing a vast onslaught of still tougher and memorably unpleasant nonhumans who even the villains must oppose. Meanwhile, various characters skirmish on different parts of the map, and the hero struggles with unreliable powers conferred on him when he was chosen as Earth King to save the land and humanity--or maybe only a tiny part of each. </p><p> Farland maintains a steady flow of new situations, reversals, gambits, and surprises ... it's a real shock when one chap who has incurred a dreadful penalty for virtuous reasons is not spared (as expected in the normal chivalry of fantasyland) but rather pays the full, eye-watering price. One small criticism: the writing contains occasional sloppiness and repetition. Nonetheless, this is a rousing, painfully gripping story. <i>--David Langford, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Praise for David Farland's <i>The Runelords</i>:<p> "<i>The Runelords</i> heralds the arrival of a serious contender for the Jordan crown." --Michael Stackpole</p><p> "A first-rate tale, an epic fantasy that more than delivers on its promise. Read it soon and treat yourself to an adventure you won't forget." --Terry Brooks</p><p> "When I reached the end of this first volume and saw grace arise from a devastating battlefield where too many great hearts lay dead, Farland had earned the tears that came to my eyes. It was not sentiment but epiphany." --Orson Scott Card</p><p> "In <i>The Runelords</i> David Farland has created a vivid, detailed, different world that becomes perfectly believable. The characters are real, the action fast, and the sum a brilliant and engrossing novel." --David Drake</p><p> "David Farland is the single greatest discovery of my professional career." --Algis Budrys</p><p> "With <i>The Runelords</i>, David Farland breaks new ground in fantasy fiction and wakes up anyone who thought they'd read everything the genre had to offer." --Kevin J. Anderson</p><p> "A bloody, violent, grim saga, with thoughtfully devised magics and a well-turned plot...satisfying and involving." --<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p> "<i>The Runelords</i> is a wonderful fantasy novel." --Robert J. Sawyer</p><p> "The intriguing hook behind Farland's first novel--and launch of a new fantasy series--is a complex magical technology whereby abilities such as wit, brawn, and stamina are transferable from person to person. The magic is basic to Farland's story, not just painted on, and it and the society in which it plays out are rigorously and imaginatively elaborated." --<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p></p><h2>The Cat of Bubastes</h2><p>Chebron and his sister flee Egypt after the sacred cat of Bubastes is accidently killed.</p><p>George Alfred Henty (8 December 1832 to 16 November 1902), was a prolific English novelist, special correspondent and Imperialist.

But before he created the perfect home for himself in a small patch of downtown New York, Eddie wandered the American wilderness looking for a place to call his own. &nbsp;<br><br>Eddie grew up in theme-park America, on a could-be-anywhere cul-de-sac in suburban Orlando, raised by a wild family of FOB (&#x201c;fresh off the boat&#x201d;) hustlers and hysterics from Taiwan. While his father improbably launched a series of successful seafood and steak restaurants, Eddie burned his way through American culture, defying every &#x201c;model minority&#x201d; stereotype along the way. He obsessed over football, fought the all-American boys who called him a chink, partied like a gremlin, sold drugs with his crew, and idolized Tupac. His anchor through it all was food&#x2014;from making Southern ribs with the Haitian cooks in his dad&#x2019;s restaurant to preparing traditional meals in his mother&#x2019;s kitchen to haunting the midnight markets of Taipei when he was shipped off to the homeland. After misadventures as an unlikely lawyer, street fashion renegade, and stand-up comic, Eddie finally threw everything he loved&#x2014;past and present, family and food&#x2014;into his own restaurant, bringing together a legacy stretching back to China and the shards of global culture he&#x2019;d melded into his own identity. <br><br>Funny, raw, and moving, and told in an irrepressibly alive and original voice, <i>Fresh Off the Boat </i>recasts the immigrant&#x2019;s story for the twenty-first century.

You're a chef, but your restaurant doesn't show up in this book until pretty late. If you're not writing about your restaurant--the fabulous Baohaus in New York--then what are you writing about?</strong></p> <p>A. Food is at the core of the book, but I examine it beyond the plate, almost as a symbol. There's only one recipe in this book and there are no measurements. I want people to understand the power that food has as a gateway drug into culture and history, but, first and foremost, my book tells a story about growing up Taiwanese-Chinese in America. It's a story about unpacking your identity, purging yourself of the things your environment has imposed upon your consciousness, and trying to set yourself free. I refused the American Experience I was sold, remixed it for myself, chopped it up, and sold it back.</p> <p><strong>Q. One of the powerful aspects of the book is the language you use, which feels completely original. Where does your voice come from?</strong></p> <p>A. Language is constantly changing and the biggest disservice you can do to yourself and your reader is to write how you think you're "supposed to" write. My parents didn't really speak English at home, so I had to develop my English voice independently and mostly through pop culture--I grew up speaking Chinese, listening to hip hop, and watching cable television. Learning to trust my own voice was probably the most important thing I ever did. When I was in college, Richard Ford visited during a speaking series and criticized Ha Jin, who had just won the National Book Award, for writing in English because it wasn't his native tongue, implying that Ha Jin should stick to Chinese. I was just a half-assed student at the time, but I stood up and argued with Ford from my seat till they made me sit down. My mother speaks broken English but even with her comic disregard for subject-verb agreement, she throws mad knowledge darts. You should never worry about what others think about the language you use, as long as it's truly your own.</p> <p><strong>Q. What do you want readers to take away from Fresh Off the Boat? </strong></p> <p>A. The simple surface reading of this book is to be yourself by any means possible. That's the basic theme, but I want people to see how implementing a simple concept like that takes a struggle between you and your country, you and your city, you and your reference group, you and your family, you and your race, you and the sub cultures you subscribe to, and on and on. It's about the constant battle between that little voice inside you and the people you love, the legacy you carry, the cultures that make you curious, the country that tells you who you're supposed to be. It's about the complexity of being an individual--about finding love in family, in friends, in food, in music and culture, and a million other surprising places, and figuring out how to bring all that together inside of you. It's about learning to be fearless, but it's also about the cost of those lessons and the literal and psychic violence you encounter when you try to break free.</p> <p>There are tons of books about the struggle to be an individual, but with each one we reach more and more people who were never spoken to. I was always a weirdo growing up, but I believed that there were weirdos like me, and my writing this book is like Professor X putting on cerebro to find the other mutants.</p><b>Eddie Huang</b> is the proprietor of Baohaus.

In that time, he has taken on dozens of groundbreaking cases and emerged as a pivotal figure in race relations in America. Cochran gained international recognition as one of America's best - and most controversial lawyers - for leading 'the Dream Team' defense of accused killer O.J. Simpson in the Trial of the Century. Many people formed their perception of Cochran based on his work in that trial. But long before the Simpson trial and since then Johnnie Cochran has been a leader in the fight for justice for all Americans. This is his story.<br><br>Cochran emerged from the trial as one of the nation's leading African-American spokespersons - and he has done most of his talking through the courtroom. Abner Louima. Amadou Diallo. The racially-profiled New Jersey Turnpike Four. Sean "P. Diddy" Combs. Patrick Dorismond. Cynthia Wiggins. These are the names that have dominated legal headlines - and Cochran was involved with each of them. No one who first encountered him during the Simpson trial can appreciate his impact on our world until they've read his whole story.<br><br>Drawing on Cochran's most intriguing and difficult cases, <i>A Lawyer's Life</i> shows how he's fought his critics, won for his clients, and affected real change within the system. This is an intimate and compelling memoir of one lawyer's attempt to make us all truly equal in the eyes of the law.<br></p><p>Johnnie Cochran had been famed as a folksy oratory in Los Angeles courtrooms since the 1960s, but the 1995 O.J. Simpson trial catapulted him to international fame--a status he gladly acknowledges in this bare-knuckles memoir of his years in court.<p> Cochran doesn't spend much time revisiting the Simpson case (except to proclaim O.J. innocent). Cochran devotes most of his account to less-celebrated cases that address repeated themes--police negligence and outright perjury; the difficulties minorities face in securing impartial justice; the inherent unfairness of racial profiling. Cochran describes his methods, and explains the reason for his rhyming summations ("If the glove doesn't fit, you must acquit"): "Juries enjoyed them, understood them, and, more importantly, remembered them."</p><p> Readers may not be won over by Cochran, but his book will be widely enjoyed and remembered. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Johnnie Cochran was born in Shreveport, Louisiana in 1937.

Each volume covers a specific church father and illuminates the exegesis that undergirds the Nicene Creed.<br><br>"If Christian theology had superheroes, Athanasius would perhaps lead the list thanks to his sometimes single-handed struggle to maintain trinitarian orthodoxy. Leithart's excellent study shows Athanasius to be christocentric in his biblical interpretation and theology long before Barth made it fashionable to be so. The 'sense of the Fathers' is indeed being visited upon their evangelical great-grandchildren, and with mostly salutary effect. Leithart has got the Foundations of Theological Exegesis and Christian Spirituality series off to a splendid start."--<b>Kevin J. Vanhoozer</b>, Wheaton College and Graduate School<br><br>"Peter Leithart has authored a remarkably good book. He possesses an in-depth and insightful knowledge of the entire Athanasian corpus, and he has examined all of the relevant secondary literature. His scholarship is impeccable. Moreover, Leithart's splendid and stimulating originality resides in his clear and lucid articulation of Athanasius's biblical theology and the metaphysics that lies within that biblical theology. Thus, he has made a substantial contribution to growing academic appreciation of the indispensable and fruitful relationship between the biblical text and the doctrinal statement. Leithart's <i>Athanasius</i> is, as a result, a fresh, perceptive, and rewarding study."--T<b>homas G. Weinandy, OFM, Cap</b>, The Secretariat for Doctrine, United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Washington, DC<br><br>"The action of this book occurs on three levels at least: most obviously, it is a presentation of Athanasius in his confrontation with Arianism; then, too, the author conducts his own engagement with some modern and contemporary scholars both in their interpretation of Athanasius and in their treatment of the substantive questions; and finally, some perennial issues of scriptural exegesis and hermeneutics peep more directly through in many places. Peter Leithart describes his governing systematic purpose as the 'evangelization of metaphysics,' and it may be affirmed that classical doctrines of the Trinity and the incarnation here shine through in all their soteriological strength."--<b>Geoffrey Wainwright</b>, Duke Divinity School<b>Peter J.

He was married to Edith Ray Gregorson from 1941 to 1957. In 1946 the couple, along with Tom and Angela Rolt, set up the Inland Waterways Association to preserve the canals of Britain. It was in 1951 that Aickman, along with Elizabeth Jane Howard, published his first ghost stories entitled <i>We Are the Dark</i>. Aickman went on to publish eleven more volumes of horror stories as well as two fantasy novels and two volumes of autobiography. He also edited the first eight volumes of <i>The Fontana Book of Great Ghost Stories</i>. He died in February 1981.Since his death several years ago, British writer Aickman's reputation has continued to grow among connoisseurs of the horror story. Unlike much of the current form, full of blood, monsters and melodrama, Aickman's stories achieve a quieter, more subtle and, in several ways, more lasting sense of disquiet. His lucid, finely tuned prose moves imperceptibly from the small crises and celebrations of ordinary life into another sphere. In these 11 stories, the occasion may be a walking tour of Northern England, a birthday present of a Victorian dollhouse or a stay at a Swedish sanatorium for insomniacs, but it simultaneously traps the characters with dread and opens them up to a new awareness of a greater, deeper and more dangerous world. A remarkable collection by an author who deserves to be better known. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Alfred Hitchcock &amp; the Making of Psycho</h2><p>Here is the complete inside story on the making of psycho, the forerunner of all psychothrillers. Rebello takes us behind the scenes at the creation of one of cinema&#x2019;s boldest and most influential films. From Hitchcock&#x2019;s private files and from new in-depth interviews with the stars, writers, and technical crew we get a unique and unparalleled view of the master at work.<br><br>Rebello&#x2019;s carefully researched book tells us everything we could ever want to know about the making of psycho. Starting from the gruesome crimes that inspired the novel on which the film is based, he takes us through the novel&#x2019;s adaptation into a screenplay and the film&#x2019;s preproduction, shooting, postproduction, and ultimate reception. Rebello&#x2019;s technique is as painstaking and thorough as<br>Hitchcock&#x2019;s he includes an incredible amount of detail and in doing so reveals what mattered the most to Hitchcock in the process of making his movies.</p><p>If you don't believe us when we say that Stephen Rebello's <i>Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho</i> is a killer book concerning the killer movie of all time, then why don't you listen to Tony Perkins, the star? Perkins called this scholarly yet super-readable volume "marvelously researched and irresistible ... required reading not only for <i>Psycho</i>-philes, but also for anyone interested in the backstage world of movie creation." And <i>Time</i> critic Richard Schickel (biographer of Clint Eastwood) calls Rebello's book "one of the best accounts of the making of an individual movie we've ever had." <p> It's even more reliable than Francois Truffaut's magisterial interview book <i>Hitchcock</i>, because Rebello interviewed the fat master himself, plus many <i>Psycho</i> insiders less cagey and truth-dodging than he. </p><p> At last, thanks to Rebello, we know all about the celebrated shower murder scene and all that swirls around it. Like Ernst Lubitsch, who conveyed the thrill of adultery by having the lovers open a door and cast their shadows on a bed, Hitchcock knew that, in film, artful discretion can be the most shocking effect of all. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>Praise for <i>Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho</i>:<p> "Essential...I've learned so much from reading this book." --Gus Van Sant</p><p> "Meticulously researched and irresistible...required reading not only for <i>Psycho</i>-philes, but also for anyone interested in the backstage world of movie-creation." --Anthony Perkins</p><p> "Rebello talked with virtually every surviving participant in the filmmaking. The result is a book that will inform cineastes and indulge <i>Psycho</i>manes." --<i>The Washington Post Book World</i></p><p> "Meticulous history...helps the reader comprehend the original shock of the film." --<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p> "We are indebted to Stephen Rebello's labor of love.

Among her highly acclaimed titles are: Les Miserables (9781406353167), Greek Myths (9781406303476), Mr William Shakespeare&#39;s Plays (9780744569469), God and His Creations: Tales from the Old Testament (9781844285280) and Oliver Twist and Other Great Dickens Stories (9781406305630). She is also the author of Lizzy Bennet&#39;s Diary (9781406346947), the story of Pride and Prejudice in Lizzy Bennet&#39;s own words, and the bestselling Archie&#39;s War (9781406304275) and My Secret War Diary by Flossie Albright (9781406309409), diary-style accounts of the First and Second World Wars. Marcia lives in London, SW13.Grade 2-6-The success of Williams's Greek Myths for Young Children (Candlewick, 1992) is no surprise to those whose first exposure to the classics through "Classic Comics" led to a comfortable and even enthusiastic view of literature. The lively cartoon format never overwhelms the clear progress of the stories. While the technique used in her latest book may boggle the mind of a struggling adult, it should be child's play to average elementary-school readers. Each of the seven selections, Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, The Winter's Tale, Julius Caesar, Midsummer Night's Dream, and The Tempest, is told as if it were on a stage, with cartoon panels carrying the actions and direct quotations from the play. The author's narration appears below the panels. An audience surrounds this presentation on three sides of each page. Not only are the stories complex and multilayered, but the byplay in the audience also further complicates these busy pages. As Hamlet struggles with his decision, orange sellers work a crowd that comments irreverently on the play. Queen Elizabeth I and Will himself appear at more than one production. Macbeth, which has a relatively simple story line, is told in larger panels and is not as hard to follow. The Winter's Tale is also not badly served by this treatment, although it's disappointing to find the most cartoonish stage direction in all of Shakespeare, "Exit, pursued by a bear," omitted. While it's hard to imagine anyone except maybe Robin Williams taking this on as a read-aloud, the kids who pore over detail in "Waldo" or Graeme Base's Animalia (Abrams, 1993) may graduate to enjoying an introduction to the plays in this format.<br><i>Sally Margolis, Barton Public Library, VT</i><br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Spanish Cockpit: An Eyewitness Account of the Spanish Civil War</h2><p>"...not only a model of what the study of revolution should be, but one of the best books ever published on Spain."--<i>Gerald Brenan</i>.

Kennedy</h2><p>This thorough, objective, and well-documented study of the assassination of John F. Kennedy is based on many years of research and exhaustive interviewing of hundreds of people</p><p>Investigative reporter Hurt here assembles an overview of evidence, circumstance and theory about the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963. In addition to reviewing the eight official inquiries and the various conspiracy theories, he minutely examines seemingly outlandish notions, such as the involvement of a Lee Harvey Oswald impostor in a Cuban conspiracy. The latter theory does not seem so outlandish after he produces a likely candidate and a witness whose testimony, though "terribly sullied," provides an abundance of plausible detail. Hurt builds a powerful case that Oswald did not kill the president or police officer J. D. Tippitt, and that he was the "patsy" he called himself shortly before Jack Ruby shot him to death. The prose is a bit breathless at timesHurt refers to the crime of the century, the autopsy of the century, etc.but after reading this book, few readers will doubt that the circumstances surrounding Kennedy's assassination remain among the mysteries of modern times, or that the components of that mystery are laid out with notable clarity here. Photos. January 27<br>Copyright 1985 Reed Business Information, Inc.Except for confirmed Kennedy assassination freaks, most readers will approach yet another study of that killing with mixed feelings. In a well-researched work, as this appears to be, the story does not lose but gains in murkiness and contradiction. Hurt highlights problemsthe apparently flawed FBI investigation, the botched autopsy (with a glance at David Lifton's work, Best Evidence, LJ 4/1/81), the role of organized crime (see G. Robert Blakey and Richard Billings, The Plot To Kill the President , LJ 2/15/81), the role of the CIA, etc.and to that extent he helps. He claims to have found and interviewed at length a minor participant in the larger conspiracy and this claim may well set the issue off again. Thus, Hurt provides no new grand theories, but plenty of purportedly new evidence and intricate reasoning.

Then there was the ch�teau itself: a sprawling palace once the residence of kings, its grounds the perfect place to play hide-and-seek. The curiosities of the small town and the time with his family as expats left such an impression on him that thirty years later Carhart returned to France with his wife to raise their two children. Touring Fontainebleau again as an adult, he began to appreciate its influence on French style, taste, art, and architecture. Each trip to Fontainebleau introduces him to entirely new aspects of the ch�teau's history, enriching his memories and leading him to Patrick Ponsot, the head of the ch�teau&#x2019;s restoration, who becomes Carhart&#x2019;s guide to the hidden Fontainebleau. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What emerges is an intimate chronicle of a time and place few have experienced. In warm, precise prose, Carhart reconstructs the wonders of his childhood as an American in postwar France, attending French schools with his brothers and sisters. His firsthand account brings to life nothing less than France in the 1950s, from the parks and museums of Paris to the rigors of French schooling to the vast ch�teau of Fontainebleau and its village, built, piece by piece, over many centuries. <i>Finding Fontainebleau</i> is for those captivated by the French way of life, for armchair travelers, and for anyone who has ever fallen in love with a place they want to visit over and over again.</p><p>The son of an air force officer, <b>Thad Carhart</b> grew up in a variety of places, including Washington, D.C.; Fontainebleau, France; Minneapolis; Amherst, Massachusetts; and Tokyo.

They make the commitments necessary to engage in learning opportunities for their own varied reasons, but though their reasons are varied, in many ways they share a common bond as adult learners, and they expect learning experiences that are responsive to their needs and preferences.<p> Approaching the diverse needs of adult learners requires that we consider the best available theories and practices. To address the various approaches and strategies available, authors Cheryl Torok Fleming and J. Bradley Garner have adapted the work of Knowles, Holton and Swanson (1998) in order to provide a variety of strategies for consideration by adult educators.</p><p> One of the major goals of this work is to provide an accessible and easy-to-implement guide for teaching adults--a book that you could easily take into the classroom, implementing one or more new teaching strategies. Think of these strategies as a starting point for your own exploration, growth, and experimentation in meeting the needs of adult learners, and your students will appreciate the efforts that you are making to meet their needs as adult learners.</p></p><p>Cheryl Torok Fleming serves as assistant dean for teaching and learning in the College of Adult and Professional Studies at Indiana Wesleyan University.

In formulating a modern answer to the question 'What is History?' Professor Carr shows that the 'facts' of history are simply those which historians have selected for scrutiny. Millions have crossed the Rubicon, but the historians tell us that only Caesar's crossing was significant. All historical facts come to us as a result of interpretative choices by historians influenced by the standards of their age. Yet if absolute objectivity is impossible, the role of the historian need in no way suffer; nor does history lose its fascination. This edition includes new material which presents the major conclusions of Professor Carr's notes for the second edition and a new preface by the author, in which he calls for &#x2018;a saner and more balanced outlook on the future'.</p><p>Edward Hallett Carr was born in 1892.

William Low's glorious illustrations pay close attention to detail while still encompassing the large-scale grandeur of Penn Station. </p><p><i>Old Penn Station</i> follows a very specific piece of New York City history, but it's not just a New York book. The author's research carefully addresses the whole history of the building, from construction to destruction, ending with an acknowledgment of its lasting legacy in terms of historical preservation. Spaces can be powerful, and <i>Old Penn Station</i> honors one particular powerful space which is sure to engender discussion about other historical buildings and monuments all across the nation. </p><p>This is a classic, beautiful book for history lovers, train lovers, and art lovers alike. </p><p><i>Old Penn Station</i> is a 2007 New York Times Book Review Best Illustrated Book of the Year and a 2008 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.</p></p><p><p><b>William Low</b> was born and raised in New York City.

Currently, he teaches at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.</p>Grade 3&#x2013;6&#x2014;Once upon a time, the railroad was the way to travel, and the Pennsylvania Railroad Company was one of the best in the business. Blocked from reaching its Manhattan goal by the depths of the Hudson River, and with a bravado showing just what money can do, the company hired workers to tunnel under and an architectural firm to build the then-grandest railroad depot going&#x2014;Pennsylvania Station. In this heavily pictorial, slim volume, Low's lyrical text and handsome illustrations pay tribute to an imposing piece of American architecture, describing its cultural impact both in its existence and its destruction. This book opens a nostalgic window into its magical vastness, and mourns its loss&#x2014;reduced to rubble dumped into the nearby Jersey marshes. Similar in tone to Harvey Stevenson's equally attractive <i>Looking at Liberty</i> (HarperCollins, 2003), Low's compassionate pen and artistic eye may have children taking second, assessing looks at "old" buildings headed for the wrecker's ball.

In <i>Three Famines</i>, award-winning author Thomas Keneally uncovers the troubling truth&#x2014;that sustained widespread hunger is historically the outcome of government neglect and individual venality. Through the lens of three of the most disastrous famines in modern history&#x2014;the potato famine in Ireland, the famine in Bengal in 1943, and the string of famines that plagued Ethiopia in the 1970s and 1980s&#x2014; Keneally shows how ideology, mindsets of governments, racial preconceptions, and administrative incompetence were, ultimately, more lethal than the initiating blights or crop failures.<p> In this compelling narrative, Keneally recounts the histories of these events while vividly evoking the terrible cost of famine at the level of the individual who starves and the nation that withers.</p></p><p><b>Thomas Keneally</b> won the Booker Prize in 1982 with <i>Schindler's Ark</i>, later made into the Academy Award-winning film <i>Schindler's List</i> by Steven Spielberg. He has written ten works of non-fiction, including his recent memoir <i>Searching for Schindler</i>. His novels <i>The Chant of Jimmy Blacksmith</i>, <i>Gossip From the Forest</i>, and <i>Confederates</i> were all shortlisted for the Booker Prize, while <i>Bring Larks and Heroes</i> and <i>Three Cheers for the Parclete</i> won the Miles Franklin Award. He lives in Australia.&#34;As reports of east Africa&#39;s famine continue to focus on drought and crop failure - natural rather than political causes - Three Famines provides a sharp and timely admonition... Keneally&#39;s writing is understated, sometimes to a fault. He witnessed the famine in Ethiopia, yet refuses to tell us what it looked or felt like. The tone is distant, but the occasional glimpses of individual suffering are all the more moving for it.&#34; Financial Times &#34;Thomas Keneally...writes vividly about the depths to which human beings descend during famines... The book is both reportage of starvation and analysis of how famine is made. The &#39;politics&#39; in his subtitle points to the fact that drought, blight and pestilence may be unavoidable but famine is a manmade phenomenon. This may be an elementary point, but it needs to be made time and again.&#34; Guardian &#34;The human story of famine is told very well and passionately by Keneally, as one might expect from the author of Schindler&#39;s Ark.&#34; Irish Examiner&#34;</p><h2>The Understanding Monster - Book Three</h2><p><p>"An urgent (and often very funny) attempt to explain a coocoo-rococo cosmology made up of garbled fragments of role-playing games, <i>Transformers </i>episodes, relaxation exercises and horror movies."&#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i></p><p>The final chapter of this epic trilogy finds our hero, Izadore, awoken with his mind, body and soul reunited.

The book reproduces Heade`s 620 known paintings, many newly discovered. These include a spectacular array of landscapes, seascapes, still lifes, tropical studies, and original compositions pairing orchids and hummingbirds.</p><p>Drawing on newly available archival resources and scholarship on this American landscape artist (1819-1904), the author offers a substantial rewriting and massive expansion of his 1975 text (Yale Univ. o.p.). Stebbins (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) brings Heade to life as an individual in a chronologically arranged essay on his life and art. Although the critical estimate of his work is not radically different from Stebbins's earlier assessment, the oeuvre catalogue has been increased dramatically, from under 400 to over 600 paintings. Despite an awkward horizontal size and inadequate binding, this title supplants the earlier one for academic collections; more popular collections may be served by the catalog of the current traveling exhibition, also by Stebbins (Martin Johnson Heade, LJ 12/99).<br><i>-Jack Perry Brown, Art Inst. of Chicago Lib. </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Write Now: A Complete Self-teaching Program for Better Handwriting</h2><p>As the subtitle states, this workbook is self-teaching, and the italic style it prescribes is easy-to-learn, practical, legible, and attractive.

He looked around at the other chained prisoners waiting in the cold, open yard, then over at the dismal huddle of people whom he had already sentenced.<br><br> He pursed his lips and continued. &#x201c;That you shall return from here, to the place whence you came. And from there to the Place of Execution. Where you shall hang by the neck until the body be dead! Dead! Dead! And the Lord have mercy on your soul.&#x201d;<br><br> The prisoner gasped and turned white. He stumbled backward, stricken. The judge smiled in grim satisfaction while the bailiffs dragged the prisoner off to a corner to join the others who had been condemned.<br><br> Molly shifted from one aching foot to the other, trying to ease the weight of the chains on her ankles. It was the fourth death sentence she had heard that morning, Molly thought, or maybe the fifth. It wasn&#x2019;t getting any easier to guess what the judge was going to say when her turn came. Everyone knew that you could be hanged for stealing anything worth more than a shilling, in London in this year 1730. Even if it was your first offense. Or you could steal more than that, a dozen times, and live. And it didn&#x2019;t seem to matter if you were only ten years old, like Molly, or really old . . . forty, even. There was no way of telling how it worked.<br><br> You couldn&#x2019;t tell bleedin&#x2019; much from the judge&#x2019;s speeches either, Molly thought. He sat there like a great, gloating carrion crow, looking down at the prisoners from his high perch. He talked a lot of bleedin&#x2019; rubbish about their sins, and the great wisdom and mercy of the law, and the love of the King for his subjects, and he said that some sins (like stealing a knife or a ring) were too great to be forgiven on earth. And while he talked, he fingered the black velvet cap that he put on for death sentences and turned it slowly in his hands, looking from the cap to the prisoner and from the prisoner to the cap. There was no way you could tell whether he was going to say the cramping-words&#x2014;the death sentence&#x2014;or something else until he either clapped the black hat on his head or else set it gently down among the piles of flowers on the high bench before him.<br><br> Today was a sentencing day. The prisoners had already been found guilty. They had been waiting in the yard since before the first dim rays of December dawn melted the frost on the cobbles. Molly longed for something to eat. Something to eat, and something warm on her hands and feet. Some of the prisoners had stuffed straw into their shoes to keep out the cold, but Molly&#x2019;s wood-and-leather clogs didn&#x2019;t have any room for straw in them. They were too small as it was. Molly had grown in the months she&#x2019;d been in prison. Her skinny wrists stuck out from her sleeves, and the hem of her linsey-woolsey dress and the shift underneath hung almost two inches above her ankles, showing the too-big gray woolen stockings that had been her mother&#x2019;s. She caught sight of her reflection in a puddle at her feet. Dark brown eyes stared out of a thin, pale face. Her tangled black hair just reached her shoulders. It had been longer once, but she had cut it off two years ago when she&#x2019;d had the smallpox.<br><br> Molly looked up at the other chained prisoners near her and tried to guess something about her fate from them. It seemed like the bailiffs and turnkeys were herding people together who were going to get the same sentences. Well, One-Eyed Jake was near her. He was a flash-cove on the Rattling Lay, stealing from coaches. Molly had seen him do it&#x2014;sneaking among coaches that were stuck in the mass of vehicles crammed together, trying to get through the narrow city gates. He would quietly slice through the leather top of a carriage and take whatever he could find inside.<br><br> Then there was another kinchin mort like herself. Molly stiffened as she recognized Hesper Crudge. Molly had never spoken to Hesper, but she knew who Hesper was. Everyone did. At least everyone on the canting lay&#x2014;all the thieves of London. Hesper had a reputation for blowing the gab. If you reported someone for stealing and they were hanged, you got a reward of forty pounds. Or so the law said. Molly had never heard of anyone actually getting the forty pounds, Hesper was willing to keep trying.<br><br> She was about Molly&#x2019;s age but a little taller, with hair that might be blond under the dirt. She had the narrow, knowing eyes of an old criminal, and a cutthroat&#x2019;s face, carefully schooled to show no expression. When Hesper saw Molly looking at her, she sneered and spat on the ground.<br><br> And who was this old biddy on Molly&#x2019;s other side? She was ancient, at least thirty years old, her stringy hair graying and her sallow skin deeply scarred by smallpox. Molly had seen her around Bartholomew&#x2019;s Fair, selling handkerchiefs that weren&#x2019;t her own. That old woman looked very likely to be fruit for the Deadly Nevergreen Tree, as they called the gallows at Tyburn.<br><br> The woman looked at Molly and smiled reassuringly.<br><br> Over in the corner, a bailiff was stirring the coals to keep the branding iron hot. Was someone going to be branded soon, or was he just making sure the fire stayed lit? Molly could smell the coal smoke from where she stood, but she couldn&#x2019;t feel the heat. It would be nice to get close enough to that fire to warm her aching fingers and toes. But not too close. Molly felt dizzy with cold, and with hunger. She hadn&#x2019;t eaten since the day before yesterday.<br><br> A gentleman was making his way across the yard, a nib cull who clearly didn&#x2019;t belong in the Old Bailey. He was dressed in pearl-gray velvet knee breeches and a matching velvet coat. Molly wondered what he was doing here. He stopped a bailiff and began talking to him, gesturing once in Molly&#x2019;s direction. She thought she had seen him somewhere before.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Rough Edges: My Unlikely Road from Welfare to Washington</h2><p><p>Jim Rogan was born to a single mother&#x2014;a cocktail waitress who was later convicted of welfare fraud; his bartender-father abandoned them both before he was born. After a rough-and-tumble childhood in San Francisco's hardscrabble Mission District&#x2014;where he was raised by his colorful extended family&#x2014;he became a political junkie at the age of nine, and once received help with his homework from Harry Truman. But Rogan traveled with a tough circle of friends; after years of borderline delinquency he was expelled from high school, became a porn theater bouncer, and then a bartender at a strip joint and a Hell's Angels bar. Along the way, a young Arkansas politician advised him to study law and become a member of a different kind of bar.</p> <p>In time Rogan scrapped his way through college and law school. He was appointed a Los Angeles County DA, prosecuting members of the notorious Crips and Bloods gangs; then became a judge, a state legislator, and finally a congressman from Southern California. And in 1998, as a Republican member of the House Judiciary Committee, he found himself prosecuting the impeachment of the President of the United States&#x2014;Bill Clinton, the same Arkansas politician who advised him to go into law and politics two decades earlier.</p> <p><em>Rough Edges</em> is a rarity among Washington tales: full of outrageous stories, wild humor, pull-no-punches candor, and downright fun. Replete with character and characters, and told in Rogan's engaging and unswervingly frank voice, Rogan's story is certainly the most freewheeling&#x2014;and perhaps the most honest&#x2014;political memoir ever written.</p></p><p><p>James E. Rogan was until recently undersecretary of commerce and director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office in the Bush administration. From 1997 to 2001 he was a member of Congress -- a conservative Republican representing a liberal Democratic district that included many Hollywood movie studios. Before that he was majority leader of the California State Assembly, a state court judge, and a gang-murder prosecutor in Los Angeles County. Accepting the assignment by the United States House of Representatives in 1998 to help prosecute the impeachment trial against President Clinton led to Rogan's reelection defeat in 2000. He now lives in Southern California, and is currently a partner at the law firm of Venable LLP in Washington, D.C. He will open Venable's West Coast office in the summer of 2004.</p>The Congressional rogue is an ancient character in Washington folklore, dating back at least to Matthew Lyon, the Vermont Republican who publicly expectorated on the Federalist Roger Griswold in 1798, interpreting the First Amendment a bit too literally for most people's taste. (Griswold responded to this act of self-expression with one of his own -- caning Lyon on the floor of the House.) Ah, the good old days -- when the parties really hated each other. <p>A modern heir to the tradition is former California congressman James Rogan, also a former under secretary of commerce, and a footnote to the 1990s as one of the 13 House managers of impeachment. Unlike most people who scrape their way to Washington and then frantically reinvent themselves, Rogan -- to his credit -- spends most of this book celebrating his hardscrabble past. Born to a cocktail waitress and a bartender who refused to acknowledge James as his own, Rogan grew up in a series of tough neighborhoods, beginning with San Francisco's Mission District, where he was taken in as the ward of a tough stevedore grandfather. A log cabin would have seemed luxurious in comparison. </p><p>These early scenes, with their honest appraisal of the hardships of the inner city, and the boy's unconditional love for his grandfather, read decently and on occasion are genuinely moving. The problems for young Rogan, and for his readers as well, begin with the death of his grandfather on page 27. What ensues is a long and meandering narrative in which Rogan gets into some tough scrapes, slugs it out through school and an early bartending career, and eventually figures out his future. There are some entertaining reflections on wayward friends, and Rogan's mordant sarcasm lifts a narrative that otherwise would not be as fascinating as his publicists seem to find it.</p><p>One theme that will resonate with a Washington audience is Rogan's early obsession with political memorabilia -- he must have been the only child in America who fell hard for Hubert Humphrey, and he wrote to politicians for their autographs. An early sign of his future orientation comes during a moment of considerable poetic license, when he remembers the young Republicans at the 1972 Convention (he attended as a 14-year-old) as "young, hip and fun." But as with so many morality plays, the best moments are the naughty ones, and the book loses a lot of steam as he discovers Christianity through the unlikely vehicle of the Chuck Colson tapes he listened to while jogging. Lengthy sections on his legal career do not help, and a couple of errors mar the narrative (Thomas Jefferson never served in Congress, for example). </p><p>Then, at the very end of the book, something strange happens. After breathlessly pointing us toward what he and his publicists brag about as his great moment of conscience -- his decision to become a House manager during the dark days of impeachment -- Rogan ends the book with a gigantic whimper and no discussion of any of these matters, except a fleeting promise to describe his brief congressional career in a future volume. That is a shame, because readers deserve to know why he turned against Clinton, who had generously counseled the young Rogan when he came looking for advice on how to start a political career. It's like one of those vaudeville shows where the cast sneaks out before the final number so they don't have to refund the audience's money.</p><p>It is regrettable also because a more introspective Rogan could have shed light on a number of important issues, beginning with the toxic relations between the parties. He was raised a Democrat, but for reasons that he only hints at (an early dislike for hippies, amusingly rendered in an account of one of his cousin's boyfriends, and a curious obsession with Al Jolson), his cultural values drew him increasingly to the Republicans in the 1980s. A more probing examination of his decision to jump ship might have served Democrats and Republicans alike, especially in the current electoral climate, when swing voters are worth their weight in gold. But instead Rogan, like one of the gang members he prosecutes, instantly starts parroting the slogans and behavioral tics of the new organization he has joined, without going into thoughtful detail about the switch. </p><p>An honest assessment of the abortion debate would have been especially welcome. A gruesome early scene describes the back-alley abortion his mother was about to undergo after learning of her pregnancy, before running away from the horror of the operation -- and thereby sparing his life. One could find in that episode rather strong support for both the pro-life and pro-choice positions, but Rogan shies away from serious discussion. He includes some snide information about the parties in an appendix that it would be charitable to call awkward but never reflects meaningfully on the Democratic Party that sustained his grandfather throughout his life, and did far more to protect working men than Republicans ever will. A particularly odd moment occurs on page 226, when Rogan claims the GOP as the party of "minorities, the elderly, and the poor," immediately after describing welfare recipients as "bums needing a swift kick." An agent apparently told Rogan not to talk too much about the political parties because so many publishers are "liberal Democrats." But the last time I checked, HarperCollins was owned by Rupert Murdoch, and Regan Books was the home of bestselling books by Sean Hannity, Robert Bork and other right-wing luminaries. Might be time to fire that agent. <br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

The attitudes of the subjects vary dramatically. The son of Rudolf Hess, who was sentenced at Nuremberg to life imprisonment, defends his father and decries Allied justice. Edda Goring, whose father planned the concentration camps, says, "He was a good father to me, and I have always missed him. That is all you need to know." Far more searching are the statements of those who do not deny their fathers' guilt. Of the two sons of Hans Frank, the former governor general of Poland, one has publicized his contempt for his father; the other, unable to reconcile filial love with his knowledge of Frank's wartime conduct, won't have children: "After what my father did, I don't think the Frank name should go on." Others make reparations: Rolf Mengele donated the proceeds from the publication of his father's papers to a Holocaust survivors' group. Conspicuously absent, however, is an analysis of the factors that influenced each offspring's response. Illustrations not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.YA-- Posner interviews and reports on modern Germans who have struggled to come to terms with their parents' or grandparents' associations with the Nazis. The greater the degree of involvement, the more difficult the task. His subjects include relatives of some of the Third Reich's most infamous leaders, dedicated but obscure supporters, and even anti-Hitler activists. Confusion over the gulf between public and private personae, horror at the discovery of their fathers' deeds, and denial, all are made vivid by the personalization of the emotions. Rolf Mengele's discovery as a teenager of the truth about his father's identity and deeds is one of the most harrowing losses of innocence imaginable. Enough historical background is provided to make the stories accessible to non-World War II buffs, but the text quotes interviewees at length. While the author does not remain completely objective, this is nevertheless a valuable primary-source view of the war from a unique perspective. --Cathy Chauvette, Fairfax County Public Library, VA<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Faery Wicca, Book 1: Theory and Magick, a Book of Shadows and Lights (The Ancient Oral Faery Tradition of Ireland)</h2><p>Undertake an apprenticeship guided by the only published authentic teachings of Faery Wicca.

Born in obscurity and poverty, he rose to become a fierce tribal leader, and with that his dominion and power grew with astonishing speed. He blazed through Asia, razing cities to the ground. He tortured conquered inhabitants without mercy, sometimes ordering them buried alive, at other times decapitating them. Over the ruins of conquered Baghdad, Tamerlane had his soldiers erect a pyramid of 90,000 enemy heads. As he and his armies swept through Central Asia, sacking, and then rebuilding cities, Tamerlane gradually imposed an iron rule and a refined culture over a vast territory-from the steppes of Asia to the Syrian coastline. Justin Marozzi traveled in the footsteps of this fearsome emperor of Samarkand (modern-day Uzbekistan) to write this book, which is part history, part travelogue. He carefully follows the path of this infamous and enigmatic conqueror, recounting the history and the story of this cruel, cultivated, and indomitable warrior.</p><p><b>Justin Marozzi</b> is a writer and journalist who has traveled extensively throughout the Muslim world. Recently, he returned from a year in Iraq. He lives in London.By the time of his death in 1405, the Mongol conqueror Tamerlane-a pejorative derivative of the nickname "Temur the Lame"-commanded as much land and fear as any ruler in history. Literally following in the footsteps of Ghengis Khan, he built his empire with one invasion after the next, eventually amassing a kingdom that stretched "from Moscow to the Mediterranean, from Delhi to Damascus." Nonetheless, Tamerlane remains relatively unknown in the Western world, taking a historical backseat to Ghengis despite a reign and ruthlessness every bit as remarkable. Faced with such a complex and underreported subject, Marozzi delivers an exceptional account of the emperor's life, revealing him to be both an extravagantly merciless tyrant and tireless proponent for the cultural and architectural progress in his beloved Samarkand (in modern day Uzbekistan). One peculiar choice, however, is the book's subtitle, as Tamerlane killed tens of thousands of his fellow Muslims along his so-called "pilgrimage of destruction," including a particularly bloody massacre of Baghdad that left 90,000 dead, "their heads cemented into 120 towers." The subtitle certainly wasn't chosen for a lack of nicknames, as Tamerlane's life produced plenty: "Lord of the Fortunate Conjunction." "Emperor of the Age." "Unconquered Lord of the Seven Climes." "Scourge of God." The list goes on, too, leading one to wonder how it is that such a large part of the world hardly recognizes name. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She illustrated many books by other authors before she started to write her own picture books. Her own family, two sons and a daughter, were very young then and she learned the craft of storytelling mostly by reading to them. Her books have won many awards and are published in Europe, China, Japan, and the Far East, as well as Australia, Canada, the U. K., and the U. S. A. She travels widely, talking to and drawing for children in schools and libraries as well as at adult conventions. <p>Shirley is married to an architect, now retired, and they have lived in the same family house, overlooking a London square garden, for more than forty years. They have, to date, six grandchildren who keep them on their toes.In Her Own Words...</p><p>"I grew up in a nice, quiet, well-behaved suburb of Liverpool. But our uneventful lives were rudely interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. Wewent to school carrrying gas masks, did air-raid shelter drills, saved Up mountains of scrap metal, and attempted to knit Mufflers for the troops. (Mine were very long; I never quite got the hang of casting off.)I slept under the stairs (hiring the winter of the big blitz, when we saw the sky over Liverpool lit by searchlights, tracer bullets, and Fires from the burning docks.</p><p>"All this may sound very exciting, But the problem with wartime is that when it's not frightening, it's deadly dull. You can't go on holiday, the grown-ups are too harassed and exhausted to pay much attention to amusements, and every nice kind of food is scarce. I recall, on a rare trip to the seaside (the beach was out of bounds, full of barbed wire and concrete gun emplacements), gazing at a longempty slot machine which had held chocolate bars and now seemed like a rusting icon from another world.</p><p>"Nevertheless, we managed to have a good time. We drew a lot, read and wrote stories, and got up magazines. (Mine was called, rather unoriginally, 'Girl's Own.) We acted plays, dressed in homemade costumes, to any audience we could press into service, cats included. Later, we became hopelessly stageand movie-struck. I think that by accident I had an ideal childhood for an illustrator. In a pre-televisual age, our Sunday afternoon outings, if we were lucky, were to Liverpool Art Gallery, which was cram-full of Victorian an narrative paintings with titles like 'The Hopeless Dawn,' 'Too Late!,' and 'When Did You Last See Your Father?' Tremendous stuff, and it fueled my lifelong conviction that stories and pictures belong together. I think most children probably feel the same.</p><p>"With me, drawing and painting stuck. I was never much good at anything else, so I went on doing them. Writing was a secret thing, kept well under wraps. When I emerged from art school, I wrote to a distinguished typographer saying I wanted to illustrate children's books. He wrote back saying that this was impossible 'except as an adjunct to teaching or matrimony.' All the same, I was determined to do it.</p><p>"When I think of an idea for a story, it always starts with a very strong image in my head, usually of a child doing something. With picture books, the words are unthinkable without the images-the two develop together, like a film. Alfie first made his appearance running up the street ahead of his mum, who came trundling behind with the shopping and his baby sister, Annie Rose, in the buggy. I knew from the first moment I reached for a pencil to get down a rough drawing of him that he was positively pink in the face with determination to get into the action. A lot has happened to him-and to mesince. He is a very ordinary little boy, a kind of fouryear-old Everyman just beginning to come to grips with the complexities of life. Now, rather to my amazement, well over two million Alfie books have been sold worldwide. But I still relate back to that rapid sketch done in a state of high excitement, which is where it all began."</p>&#34;This is Hughes&#39; most heartwarming picture book ...

It was on the heels of the notorious Voronezh sightings of 1989 and the first warm breezes of glasnost that Vallee was invited by the Soviet press agency Novosti to visit the USSR to meet with leading Soviet ufologists. In this chronological account of that trip, the author blends pungent travelogue with crisp science reporting, noting, for instance, that ``the depression that engulfs you as you get closer to the Soviet Union is not a delusion....It was as if light itself had been confiscated. There was a dreary blanket over the airport buildings, the dusty air, the people themselves.'' Yet upon his arrival Vallee found myriad scientists eager to exchange notes--an ironic result, he realized, of ``censorship itself,'' which had forced Soviet ufology into ``unofficial networks'' where it flourished. In sit-downs with Soviet researchers, he discussed in detail the Tunguska explosion of 1908 (perhaps caused by destruction of a nuclear-powered craft), the Voronezh incidents, and about 40 other close encounters, and marvelled at the widespread Soviet technique of ``biolocation''--a kind of dowsing of ``biological fields''--to investigate UFOs. He also visited the cosmonauts' training center, learning--and here reporting apparently for the first time in the West--that Yuri Gagarin was drunk when he fatally crashed his airplane. And, gratifyingly, Vallee found considerable Soviet interest in his core theory that UFOs are extradimensional, not extraterrestrial. A ``preliminary catalogue'' of Soviet UFO sightings appends the text. An intriguing example of glasnost in action and an important ufological document opening up rich new veins of exploration for researchers and buffs alike. (Eight-page photo insert--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Before Gorbachev, the study of UFOs in Russia depended on samizdat dissemination, but with the advent of glasnost, publication of UFO sightings is no longer restricted, according to the author. In 1990, American ufologist Vallee ( Revelations ) visited the Soviet Union with French journalist Martine Castello to talk with scientists and interview those who claim to have contact with UFOs. Like accounts of sightings in this country, the Soviet sightings generally feature space vehicles either round or saucer-shaped, with creatures, if present, more or less anthropomorphic and ranging in height from three to 10 feet, some with three eyes or outsize mouths. Only believers in UFOs will find this report convincing. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Healing with Crystals and Chakra Energies</h2><p>Create balance by color scheme Power and quality analysis of crystals Vibrational energy Chakra Stones</p><p></p><h2>The Lincoln Highway: Main Street across America</h2><p><p>Ten years after its original publication, Drake Hokanson's best-selling book continues to inspire readers to leave the interstate for a road less traveled, but one that still fuels the American preoccupation with the open road.</p><p>In his new introduction to this tenth anniversary edition, Hokanson revisits the Lincoln Highway and finds it changed&#x2014;much for the better&#x2014;since the original publication of this book.

He grew up in Brooklyn where he went to grammar school and at the age of eight he gained his citizen papers. A remarkable memory helped him finish high school before he was sixteen. He then went on to Columbia University and resolved to become a chemist rather than follow the medical career his father had in mind for him. He graduated in chemistry and after a short spell in the Army he gained his doctorate in 1949 and qualified as an instructor in biochemistry at Boston University School of Medicine where he became Associate Professor in 1955, doing research in nucleic acid. Increasingly, however, the pressures of chemical research conflicted with his aspirations in the literary field, and in 1958 he retired to full-time authorship while retaining his connection with the University. Asimov&#39;s fantastic career as a science fiction writer began in 1939 with the appearance of a short story, `Marooned Off Vesta&#39;, in Amazing Stories. Thereafter he became a regular contributor to the leading SF magazines of the day including Astounding, Astonishing Stories, Super Science Stories and Galaxy. He won the Hugo Award four times and the Nebula Award once. With nearly five hundred books to his credit and several hundred articles, Asimov&#39;s output was prolific by any standards. Apart from his many world-famous science fiction works, Asimov also wrote highly successful detective mystery stories, a four-volume History of North America, a two-volume Guide to the Bible, a biographical dictionary, encyclopaedias, textbooks and an impressive list of books on many aspects of science, as well as two volumes of autobiography. Isaac Asimov died in 1992 at the age of 72.<p>1. TECHNICIAN</p><p>Andrew Harlan stepped into the kettle. Its sides were perfectly round and it fit snugly inside a vertical shaft composed of widely spaced rods that shimmered into an unseeable haze six feet above Harlan&#x2019;s head. Harlan set the controls and moved the smoothly working starting lever.</p><p>The kettle did not move.</p><p>Harlan did not expect it to. He expected no movement; neither up nor down, left nor right, forth nor back. Yet the spaces between the rods had melted into a gray blankness which was solid to the touch, though nonetheless immaterial for all that. And there was the little stir in his stomach, the faint (psychosomatic?) touch of dizziness, that told him that all the kettle contained, including himself, was rushing upwhen through Eternity.</p><p>He had boarded the kettle in the 575th Century, the base of operations assigned him two years earlier. At the time the 575th had been the farthest upwhen he had ever traveled. Now he was moving upwhen to the 2456th Century.</p><p>Under ordinary circumstances he might have felt a little lost at the prospect. His native Century was in the far downwhen, the 95th Century, to be exact. The 95th was a Century stiffly restrictive of atomic power, faintly rustic, fond of natural wood as a structural material, exporters of certain types of distilled potables to nearly everywhen and importers of clover seed. Although Harlan had not been in the 95th since he entered special training and became a Cub at the age of fifteen, there was always that feeling of loss when one moved outwhen from "home." At the 2456th he would be nearly two hundred forty millennia from his birth when and that is a sizable distance even for a hardened Eternal.</p><p>Under ordinary circumstances all this would be so.</p><p>But right now Harlan was in poor mood to think of anything but the fact that his documents were heavy in his pocket and tense, a little confused.</p><p>It was his hands acting by themselves that brought the kettle to the proper halt at the proper Century.</p><p>Strange that a Technician should feel tense or nervous about anything. What was it that Educator Yarrow had once said:</p><p>"Above all, a Technician must be dispassionate. The Reality Change he initiates may affect the lives of as many as fifty billion people. A million or more of these may be so drastically affected as to be considered new individuals. Under these conditions, an emotional make-up is a distinct handicap."</p><p>Harlan put the memory of his teacher&#x2019;s dry voice out of his mind with an almost savage shake of his head. In those days he had never imagined that he himself would have the peculiar talent for that very position. But emotion had come upon him after all. Not for fifty billion people. What in Time did he care for fifty billion people? There was just one. One person.</p><p>He became aware that the kettle was stationary and with the merest pause to pull his thoughts together, put himself into the cold, impersonal frame of mind a Technician must have, he stepped out. The kettle he left, of course, was not the same as the one he had boarded, in the sense that it was not composed of the same atoms. He did not worry about that any more than any Eternal would. To concern oneself with the mystique of Time-travel, rather than with the simple fact of it, was the mark of the Cub and newcomer to Eternity.</p><p>He paused again at the infinitely thin curtain of non-Space and non-Time which separated him from Eternity in one way and from ordinary Time in another.</p><p>This would be a completely new section of Eternity for him. He knew about it in a rough way, of course, having checked upon it in the Temporal Handbook. Still, there was no substitute for actual appearance and he steeled himself for the initial shock of adjustment.</p><p>He adjusted the controls, a simple matter in passing into Eternity (and a very complicated one in passing into Time, a type of passage which was correspondingly less frequent). He stepped through the curtain and found himself squinting at the brilliance. Automatically he threw up his hand to shield his eyes.</p><p>Only one man faced him. At first Harlan could see him only blurrily.</p><p>The man said, "I am Sociologist Kantor Voy. I imagine you are Technician Harlan."</p><p>Harlan nodded and said, "Father Time! Isn&#x2019;t this sort of ornamentation adjustable?"</p><p>Voy looked about and said tolerantly, "You mean the molecular films?"</p><p>"I certainly do," said Harlan. The Handbook had mentioned them, but had said nothing of such an insane riot of light reflection.</p><p>Harlan felt his annoyance to be quite reasonable. The 2456th Century was matter-oriented, as most Centuries were, so he had a right to expect a basic compatibility from the very beginning. It would have none of the utter confusion (for anyone born matter-oriented) of the energy vortices of the 300&#x2019;s, or the field dynamics of the 600&#x2019;s. In the 2456th, to the average Eternal&#x2019;s comfort, matter was used for everything from walls to tacks.</p><p>To be sure, there was matter and matter. A member of an energy-oriented Century might not realize that. To him all matter might seem minor variations on the theme that was gross, heavy, and barbaric. To matter-oriented Harlan, however, there was wood, metal (subdivisions, heavy and light), plastic, silicates, concrete, leather, and so on.</p><p>But matter consisting entirely of mirrors!</p><p>That was his first impression of the 2456th. Every surface reflected and glinted light. Everywhere was the illusion of complete smoothness; the effect of a molecular film. And in the ever-repeated reflection of himself, of Sociologist Voy, of everything he could see, in scraps and wholes, in all angles, there was confusion. Garish confusion and nausea!</p><p>"I&#x2019;m sorry," said Voy, "it&#x2019;s the custom of the Century, and the Section assigned to it finds it good practice to adopt the customs where practical. You get used to it after a time."</p><p>Voy walked rapidly upon the moving feet of another Voy, upside down beneath the floor, who matched him stride for stride. He reached to move a hair-contact indicator down a spiral scale to point of origin.</p><p>The reflections died; extraneous light faded. Harlan felt his world settle.</p><p>"If you&#x2019;ll come with me now," said Voy.</p><p>Harlan followed through empty corridors that, Harlan knew, must moments ago have been a riot of made light and reflection, up a ramp, through an anteroom, into an office.</p><p>In all the short journey no human being had been visible. Harlan was so used to that, took it so for granted, that he would have been surprised, almost shocked, if a glimpse of a human figure hurrying away had caught his eyes. No doubt the news had spread that a Technician was coming through. Even Voy kept his distance and when, accidentally, Harlan&#x2019;s hand had brushed Voy&#x2019;s sleeve, Voy shrank away with a visible start.</p><p>Harlan was faintly surprised at the touch of bitterness he felt at this. He had thought the shell he had grown about his soul was thicker, more efficiently insensitive than that. If he was wrong, if his shell had worn thinner, there could only be one reason for that.</p><p>No�s!</p><p>Sociologist Kantor Voy leaned forward toward the Technician in what seemed a friendly enough fashion, but Harlan noted automatically that they were seated on opposite sides of the long axis of a fairly large table.</p><p>Voy said, "I am pleased to have a Technician of your reputation interest himself in our little problem here."</p><p>"Yes," said Harlan with the cold impersonality people would expect of him. "It has its points of interest." (Was he impersonal enough? Surely his real motives must be apparent, his guilt be spelled out in beads of sweat on his forehead.)</p><p>He removed from an inner pocket the foiled summary of the projected Reality Change. It was the very copy which had been sent to the Allwhen Council a month earlier. Through his relationship with Senior Computer Twissell (the Twissell, himself) Harlan had had little trouble in getting his hands on it.</p><p>Before unrolling the foil, letting it peel off onto the table top where it would be held by a soft paramagnetic field, Harlan paused a split moment.</p><p>The molecular film that covered the table was subdued but was not zero. The motion of his arm fixed his eye and for an instant the reflection of his own face seemed to stare somberly up at him from the tabletop. He was thirty-two, but he looked older. He needed no one to tell him that. It might be partly his long face and dark eyebrows over darker eyes that gave him the lowering expression and cold glare associated with the caricature of the Technician in the minds of all Eternals. It might be just his own realization that he was a Technician.</p><p>But then he flicked the foil out across the table and turned to the matter at hand.</p><p>"I am not a Sociologist, sir."</p><p>Voy smiled. "That sounds formidable. When one begins by expressing lack of competence in a given field, it usually implies that a flat opinion in that field will follow almost immediately."</p><p>"No," said Harlan, "not an opinion. Just a request. I wonder if you won&#x2019;t look over this summary and see if you haven&#x2019;t made a small mistake somewhere here."</p><p>Voy looked instantly grave. "I hope not," he said.</p><p>Harlan kept one arm across the back of his chair, the other in his lap. He must let neither hand drum restless fingers. He must not bite his lips. He must not show his feelings in any way.</p><p>Ever since the whole orientation of his life had so changed itself, he had been watching the summaries of projected Reality Changes as they passed through the grinding administrative gears of the Allwhen Council. As Senior Computer Twissell&#x2019;s personally assigned Technician, he could arrange that by a slight bending of professional ethics. Particularly with Twissell&#x2019;s attention caught ever more tightly in his own overwhelming project. (Harlan&#x2019;s nostrils flared. He knew now a little of the nature of that project.)</p><p>Harlan had had no assurance that he woul...</p></p><h2>Leave It Better Than You Found It</h2><p>A book written by the Nordstrom Brothers describing the start of the Nordstrom company and its history throughout the generations. A must read book!</p><p></p><h2>The Twisted Root: A William Monk Mystery</h2><p>In a stunning feat of the imagination, Anne Perry encloses readers within the magic circle of her genius and brings to life the lost world of England's Victorian Age. Hoofbeats clatter on cobblestones, gaslight glimmers through fog, and in the exclusive privacy of elegant drawing rooms, powerful men and women once again live the splendor and shame of that matchless era. With The Twisted Root, Perry holds us rapt with a chilling story of love, betrayal, and consummate evil.<br><br>As private investigator William Monk listens to young Lucius Stourbridge plead for help in tracking down his runaway fianc�e, he feels a sense of heavy foreboding. Miriam Gardiner disappeared suddenly from a croquet party at the luxurious Bayswater mansion of her in-laws-to-be, and has not been seen since. But on Hampstead Heath, Monk finds the coach in which Miriam had fled and, nearby, the murdered body of the coachman. There is no trace of Miriam.<br><br>What strange compulsion could have driven the beautiful widow to abandon the prospect of a loving marriage and financial abundance? Monk's attempt to answer that question proves a challenge, as Miriam Gardiner's fateful flight ends in a packed London courtroom where brilliant barrister Oliver Rathbone wages an uphill battle to absolve her from a charge of murder. And in a race with the hangman, Monk and clever nurse Hester Latterly--themselves now newlyweds--desperately pursue the elusive truth . . . and an unknown killer whose malign brilliance they have scarcely begun to fathom.</p><p>William Monk, the unquestionably handsome, somewhat vain, but genuinely tenderhearted "agent of enquiry" is back on the streets of Victorian London, investigating his 10th case, a missing woman. Miriam Gardiner was due to be betrothed to a much younger man, a well-to-do gentleman named Lucius Stourbridge. But during a family croquet party, the bride-to-be vanished, apparently fleeing in a coach driven by a family servant named Treadwell. Monk would normally be reluctant to get involved in a simple case of pre-wedding jitters, but his own recent marriage to the headstrong nurse Hester Latterly gives him a newfound empathy for the heartbroken Lucius. Of course, as always in Perry's historical mysteries, all is not quite as it seems. Treadwell is found murdered, and the missing Miriam becomes the number-one suspect. Monk is convinced that she "could and would do no intentional evil," even as Hester connects her to another illicit crime. Eventually unearthed by London's finest, Miriam is arrested and charged with murder, and it's up to barrister Oliver Rathbone to absolve her in court (with a little help from his good friends William and Hester Monk). <p> With a plot twist around every corner, Anne Perry knows just how to keep us in suspense, right up to the exceedingly dramatic finale. <i>The Twisted Root</i> is a luminous whodunit from the queen of Victorian mystery. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i></p>&#34;Captivating...One of Perry&#39;s most engrossing puzzlers.&#34; --People, Page-Turner of the Week</p><h2>New Cinematographers</h2><p><p>A cinematographer's skill can make or break a film's overall look, and yet cinematographers are legendarily reticent to discuss their craft.New Cinematographers meets this challenge, featuring the the work of six major, young, contemporary cinematographers whose vision defines the way films look today.

Steig was born in New York City. Every member of his family was involved in the arts, and so it was no surprise when he decided to become an artist. He attended City College and the National Academy of Design. In 1930, Steig&#x2019;s work began appearing in <i>The New Yorker</i>, where his drawings have been a popular fixture ever since. He published his first children's book, <i>Roland the Minstrel Pig</i>, in 1968. &nbsp;In 1970, Steig received the Caldecott Medal for <i>Sylvester and the Magic Pebble</i>. His books for children also include <i>Dominic</i>; <i>The Real Thief</i>; <i>The Amazing Bone</i>, a Caldecott Honor Book; <i>Amos &amp; Boris</i>, a National Book Award finalist; and <i>Abel's Island</i> and <i>Doctor De Soto</i>, both Newbery Honor Books.

This Shrek is an ogre inside and out. Narrator Robert Sevra reads with expression, a good steady pace, and great quivering voices for Shrek, his princess, and the cackling witch. The background music and other sounds provide a jaunty accompaniment, and kids who enjoy silly, nonsensical rhymes will enjoy the snippets of poetry. Although not an easy read for most 6 to 8-year-olds, this book's illustrations and narration will engage them over and over again.

Among those interviewed are Fay Jones, Aaron Green, John Lautner, Anthony Putnam, Paolo Soleri, and Edgar Tafel.</p><p>A Taliesin Legacy The Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright&#x2019;s Apprentices Tobias S. Guggenheimer In the decades since the death of Frank Lloyd Wright the world has puzzled over the fate of the hundreds of young people who worked and trained at the Taliesin Fellowship, Wright&#x2019;s revolutionary center for design education. Did Wright mold skilled architects capable of applying his philosophy in creative projects around the world? Or as some critics claimed, did Taliesin produce only hangers-on and imitators? Anyone with a passion for architecture has wondered about the answer to these questions. In this book, A Taliesin Legacy: The Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright&#x2019;s Apprentices, the foremost authority on the work of the Taliesin apprentices, Tobias Guggenheimer, eloquently unveils the spectacular accomplishments of the disciples of the greatest architect in American history. With dramatic photographs and revealing interviews, this monumental book traces the careers of dozens of architects who apprenticed with Frank Lloyd Wright at the Wisconsin and Arizona campuses of Taliesin. Guggenheimer includes such internationally famous architects as E. Fay Jones, John Lautner, and Paolo Solari and spotlights the work of those individuals who have received insufficient previous notice &#x2014; architects whose work collectively represents the living heart of the environmentally forward looking "organic" movement. Guggenheimer&#x2019;s scope is encyclopedic and portrays organic architecture from Europe, Asia, Africa, as well as the United States. Many of the hundreds of photographs originate in the personal archives of the apprentices and have never before been published. Readers will be mesmerized as the apprentices reveal the true story of Taliesin, Wright&#x2019;s experiential alternative to university education, and describe how they absorbed Wright&#x2019;s philosophy. In an unprecedented insight into daily life with Frank Lloyd Wright, apprentices describe the evolution of Taliesin as a respected institution during Wright&#x2019;s life and how it remained vital after his death. You&#x2019;ll learn about Wright&#x2019;s teaching methods, the political hostility against the Fellowship, the international cross-fertilization engendered by Taliesin, and the growing relevance of organic architecture to contemporary concerns. A generous portfolio of drawings and photographs, many in full color, reveals how the apprentices form a significant arm of contemporary architecture. No where else is the legacy of Wright&#x2019;s architectural principles chronicled so lavishly as here. This is truly the book enthusiasts of the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright have been waiting for.About the Author Tobias Guggenheimer is an architect on the faculty of Pratt Institute School of Architecture. He teaches courses in architectural design, history, and technology and has also served as Administrator for Special Programs.

When low clouds rumbling overhead brought huge splats of rain, some ducked inside doorways, but no one returned to work or home.<p>At last the tower and the now-visible outriders exchanged the thrilling trumpet chords announcing the return of the king. The Bell Runners enthusiastically plied the ropes, and people surged from under cover to line the streets, and began to shout and pound on hand drums.</p><p>&#x201c;Evred-Harvaldar Sigun!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Evred-Harvaldar Sigun!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Evred-Harvaldar Sigun!&#x201d;</p><p>The rhythmic shout gained volume as their young king rode through the city gates, tall and straight, his red hair darkened to the shade of his father&#x2019;s by the rain, color emphasizing his cheekbones. They cheered him and his men all the way to the castle gates, and only when he was inside did they go back to work in small clumps, everybody laughing and cheerful. Innkeepers promised to draw an ale for everyone (many knowing that that would begin an evening of festive largesse) to cheer the northern victory as they looked forward to the stories the returning warriors would tell.</p><p>Inside the castle courtyard Evred slipped from his saddle, leaving his Runners to supervise as the last remnant of his army&#x2014;the King&#x2019;s Riders who guarded the city and castle&#x2014;rode over to their barracks to dismount, unpack, and then reunite with families for the promised liberty.</p><p>The warm splatters of rain dotting brown circles on the honey-colored flagstones began to merge as the young queen appeared, short like Inda, her wide brown eyes and unruly brown curls so much like his. But where Inda was broad in chest and shoulder, Hadand-Gunvaer was broad in bosom and hip. She and Evred clasped hands, and the tower sentries&#x2014;men and women&#x2014;sent up a cheer.</p><p>&#x201c;Hadand-Gunvaer Deheldegarthe!&#x201d;</p><p>Deheldegarthe: a fighting queen, one who had by her own hand defended the kingdom. It, like <i>Sigun</i> for the king, was the highest accolade&#x2014;one that must be given, never asked for.</p><p>The royal pair smiled upward, and as the rain abruptly increased walked inside together; Hadand observed her beloved&#x2019;s distant gaze, and waited for him to return from wherever his thoughts had taken him. </p><p>The air was motionless and warm inside the tower, assailing Evred with familiar smells, comfortable smells, which were now free from the power to harm; his uncle and brother had receded to occasional distorted voices in dreams. </p><p>When he and Hadand reached his outer chamber, he discovered chilled wine-and-punch waiting. &#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; he said on a long outward breath. &#x201c;How good it is to be home.&#x201d;</p><p> &#x201c;Your last report via the magic case stated that all is well in the north.&#x201d; Hadand dropped onto a waiting mat. </p><p>Evred sat down next to her, and cradled the broad, shallow wine cup in both hands. &#x201c;It is as well as can be expected. Ndand Arveas is there in the Pass, holding Castle Andahi while Cama rides back and forth from Idayago to Ghael. We&#x2019;ll have to find someone to back her until Keth grows. Though she&#x2019;s strong enough to hold it on her own.&#x201d;</p><p>Hadand&#x2019;s lips parted. She longed to say, <i>So why don&#x2019;t you make her a Jarlan, and let her pick her own Jarl? Why can&#x2019;t women command castles? </i> It seemed so obvious&#x2014;especially since it had been women who had held Castle Andahi in the teeth of the entire Venn invasion, down to the last one. </p><p>But now was not the time for new ideas. She had learned through letters from women across the kingdom that most of the men who had gone north to fight (those who returned) longed to resume the old ways, the comfort of tradition.</p><p>So she turned her attention to Evred even as he studied her. Both, out of lifetime habit, tried to descry the inner workings of the other&#x2019;s mind: as children they had shared everything, but time, and experience, had built personal boundaries that were difficult to surmount, despite their best intentions.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll have to establish watches all along the north coast,&#x201d; Evred went on, sounding tired. &#x201c;Something like Flash&#x2019;s beacon system, which would have worked, had there not been treachery from within. But I&#x2019;m keeping our best dragoon captains up there, headquartered at Ala Larkadhe, since my twin cousins want to swap off yearly as Jarls of Yvana-Vayir and commanders of the northern force.&#x201d; </p>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t they young for that?&#x201d; Hadand asked.<p>&#x201c;Year older than I was when I was first sent north to command,&#x201d; Evred said wryly. &#x201c;And yes, my authority was limited. So will theirs be, at least at first. They know Cama is under Inda in chain of command, and they report to him. They accepted it without argument. Good boys, both of them. Though Beaver never seems to stop talking.&#x201d;</p><p>Hadand said, &#x201c;Will they keep swapping off by year?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;For now. I hope by the time their cousin finishes here as a horsetail and can serve as Randael at Yvana-Vayir they&#x2019;ll settle it among themselves. . . if we do not have any more war.&#x201d;</p><p>Hadand&#x2019;s brown, unwavering gaze was so much like Inda&#x2019;s&#x2014;and yet not. Evred realized he was searching for Inda in Hadand&#x2019;s eyes. His emotions roiled until he locked them down hard. &#x201c;To finish with Ala Larkadhe, the Morvende archive in the white tower was closed to me.&#x201d;</p><p>Her face changed from the tension of worry to comprehension. She knew what that archive meant to him. &#x201c;Did the Morvende say anything?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing. I permitted the archive to be used as a transport, which seems to have alerted them. But the closing was inevitable, because I dared to lead an army to war.&#x201d; He tried, and failed, to keep the bitterness from his voice. &#x201c;It appears that no one wishes to hear my reasons.&#x201d; </p><p>Hadand poured more punch, maintaining a compassionate silence. She perceived the effort he made to relax, to look up, and around. &#x201c;All seems well here.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yes. But we had no war to contend with.&#x201d; How it hurt her, to see the effort he made; what could she do? She had worked hard to have everything just right when he came home at last, down to his favorite foods here, now rapidly cooling.</p><p>He looked blankly at the biscuits, then up. &#x201c;The war, yes. You must have questions. I know my reports were scant. Those magical boxes. I still don&#x2019;t really trust them. Even if I could send a sheaf of papers instead of quarter-sheets folded small, there was still the matter of trying to find the time to write on them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have questions indeed. Beginning with the Venn surrender. What exactly happened? I&#x2019;ve heard several conflicting accounts, and Inda has never written to me. Tdor says he wrote only that he was still alive.&#x201d;</p><p>He frowned, yet she knew Inda was all right. Tdor had sent a message when Inda arrived safely home, that they were about to marry. And though Tdor had not written since, Hadand knew that nothing disastrous had happened, or surely, surely she would have heard.</p><p>&#x201c;It really was not a surrender, though everyone believes it to have been.&#x201d; He spoke slowly, hesitating between words.</p><p> She breathed in relief. The problem was obviously not Inda. Absurd to have thought it concerned him! &#x201c;What exactly happened with the Venn? Are they really gone so suddenly? So many rumors have run ahead of you, and like you say, your report was scanty. I have it by heart now, I&#x2019;ve read it so many times, trying to wring extra meaning from every pen stroke.&#x201d;</p><p>His smile was perfunctory. &#x201c;Some of those rumors began just after the battle. I did nothing to interfere with them.&#x201d; Evred drank his punch down, then pressed his fingers to his temples, eyes closed. &#x201c;It seemed to hearten the men to think that Durasnir, the Venn Fleet Commander, surrendered to Inda. That he and Inda fought a duel. That he knelt before me and swore allegiance. None of those things happened. He asked for a truce, said that their king was dead, and that Prince Rajnir had to sail home to claim their crown.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That was all?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There was one thing more. It was very strange. I don&#x2019;t know why I did it, but I asked if they were coming back.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;d lie about that, of course,&#x201d; Hadand exclaimed.</p><p>&#x201c;So I thought the moment the words were out.&#x201d; Evred crumbled a rye biscuit without awareness of what his fingers were doing, as he thought back. &#x201c;I braced for threat, or dissembling. Scorn, even. We heard none of that. You must realize first that we learned before the attack that the one we have to fear is the mage Erkric, who was using magic in aid of the war. According to Inda&#x2019;s Venn lover, the Dag Signi&#x2014;do you remember her?&#x201d;</p><p>Hadand vividly remembered the small, older woman who had so kindly and quietly renewed all the castle magic spells for them, working all night while Evred and Inda raised the entire city to march to war. But Evred so distrusted magic that Hadand only signified assent, without speaking.</p><p>Evred said, &#x201c;She told us that Dag Erkric has attempted to strike a bargain with Norsunder in an effort to learn magic that will control minds. It is possible that he has done so.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I find that more difficult to believe than anything,&#x201d; Hadand exclaimed. &#x201c;You know how I&#x2019;ve been researching magic ever since I could read, but I&#x2019;ve never found mention of magic&#x2014;in our present time&#x2014;that does that. In the days of Old Sartor, perhaps. We thought it all figurative language.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have trouble believing it, too. I retained my distrust of Dag Signi to the end, but something that Commander Durasnir said seemed to corroborate . . . well, you tell me what you think.&#x201d; Evred leaned forward. &#x201c;He asked Inda if he&#x2019;d ever met Ramis of the <i>Knife</i>. The mystery pirate who commanded the ship with black sails.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The pirate who Inda said caused the rift <b>to</b> the sky through which the Brotherhood of Blood command ships were forced. I remember that.&#x201d; Hadand poured more punch, in hopes of getting Evred to at least drink, if he would not eat. &#x201c;I always thought this mysterious Ramis was a, oh, a dream figure or something.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Inda insists he&#x2019;s a real man. He met him. Spent some time with him in converse. Anyway, Inda answered Durasnir. Told him that Ramis had said there were three men who were dangerous to Inda: Prince Rajnir, the mage Erkric, and Durasnir himself. After which Durasnir said, &#x2018;Two of us must obey.&#x2019; And then he vanished by magic. Shortly thereafter, the Venn marched back down the pass, boarded their ships, and sailed away.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Two of them? But that just means the commander and the mage must obey the king.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why did he not say so?&#x201d;</p><p>Hadand&#x2019;s eyes narrowed, bringing Inda forcibly to mind. </p><p>She said, &#x201c;You think the Commander of the Venn, your enemy, was <i>warning</i> you in some way? But that makes no sense. A threat I can understand. A warning?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If Dag Erkric truly does control their prince&#x2014;now their king, surely&#x2014;then the warning becomes clear. The danger we both share is the threat of magic. Unfortunately Durasnir spoke in Sartoran, so the only ones of our people who understood him were Inda and Taumad.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Well, what does Inda say? He could ask Dag Signi.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t discuss the war. It&#x2019;s an honorable truce, and I understand that. As for Inda . . .&#x201d; Evred touched a ring on his hand that she had never seen before. She did not often see his hands; though they were long and beautiful, he so often hid them by clasping them behind his back.</p><p>&#x201c;As for Inda, we did not talk to much purpose. He was either riding along the lines encouraging the men, especially the wounded, or else abstracted . . .&#x201d; Evred paused, remembering the campfire conversations, painfully repetitive as Inda went over every move, almost every sword-stroke of the fights he could remember. After a few weeks of that, Evred thought it a victory when Inda shifted from what he should have done to what he could have done. </p><p>Evred looked up. &#x201c;We seldom had much time alone to discuss that.&#x201d;</p><p>Hadand did not ask why the two most powerful men in the entire kingdom couldn&#x2019;t send the entire army out of hearing, if they did not want to walk apart. There were times when speech was insufficient, even impossible. She remembered the days immediately following the Jarl of Yvana-Vayir&#x2019;s conspiracy: the vivid memory images, the long pauses when you couldn&#x2019;t remember where you were. Waking up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat, reliving the worst, and wondering if you could have done something to prevent it. Words had come with difficulty&#x2014;if at all. </p><p>She signified agreement.</p><p>He closed his eyes and faced southwest. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s on his way.&#x201d; And at Hadand&#x2019;s questioning look, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a location ring. Inda wears the other one. We used them in the Andahi Pass so we would not lose one another.&#x201d;</p><p> &#x201c;So you trust this ring, but not the golden notecases?&#x201d;</p><p>Evred&#x2019;s expression was always reserved, but now it tightened. </p><p>He made an angry, determined effort to lock away the conflict of emotions. The golden notecases had been bespelled by Dag Signi; the location rings had been provided, Evred strongly suspected, by Savarend Montredavan-An, otherwise known as Fox.</p><p>Evred knew Inda&#x2019;s loyalty to Iasca Leror&#x2014;to Evred himself--was total. Yet Inda had somehow gained the personal loyalty of not only the Venn mage, Dag Signi, but the potentially troublesome Fox, who now commanded Inda&#x2019;s old pirate fleet, and who had&#x2014;it seemed&#x2014;rescued Inda from certain death at the hands of the Venn.</p><p>Evred flexed his hand, watching the muted glint on the plain gold band as lightning flared in the window. He looked up to discover Hadand waiting, her gaze steady and unwavering. &#x201c;The rings only convey direction, no words. And Inda&#x2019;s Venn lover had nothing to do with the rings. Yes, I know she&#x2019;s proved trustworthy, but what if her unknown, unseen friends interfere? How would we know? We do not see these mages&#x2014;the Venn call them dags. We do not understand their powers. And it&#x2019;s not just them. What if some Venn warrior had killed Noddy early on, and taken his case? He had it, I found it after he died. Inside his pocket lay Inda&#x2019;s notes. The Venn could have got the plan right there. Sometimes I want to throw the lot of those gold things into the fire,&#x201d; he said in a low, savage voice. &#x201c;I may yet. If I detect the merest hint of tampering. But I admit they are useful, especially with the north so unsettled. Fast communication is essential. Cama insists that the one thing keeping the Idayagans quiet is the prospect of Inda returning.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Inda?&#x201d; Hadand&#x2019;s memory of Inda was still the smiling little boy of childhood. &#x201c;How so?&#x201d;</p><p>Evred looked away, his expression even more remote. &#x201c;You did not see him in battle. Both sides spread rumors that Inda fights like ten men, that he cannot be beaten.&#x201d; </p><p>Evred paused at the sudden, unbidden memory. In the archive, he had read: What you remember about someone teaches you more about yourself than it does about the other.</p><p>When Inda did his knife drills, his movements expressed humor as well as strength, grace as well as skill. Inda fighting to kill was an order of magnitude in difference, face purple and mouth a rictus, eyes cold as death, grunting like an animal as he unleashed that terrifying strength, and yet Evred had found that aspect of Inda as deeply stirring as all Inda&#x2019;s myriad moods and voices. If not more. How could desire and killing be so close?</p><p>But Hadand did not know that. He did not want her to know it, and so he shook his head. &#x201c;Never mind.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;At least we have peace.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. Now we have a respite. It remains to be seen for how long.&#x201d; </p><p>Hadand said, baldly, to strip the moment of the possibility of sickening coquetry, &#x201c;Since the word came that you had won, and were alive, I have been drinking gerda leaf again.&#x201d; </p><p>Evred thought of a son, and Inda raising...</p></p><h2>On the Far Side of the Mountain</h2><p>The long-awaited sequel to one of the best-loved books ever written for children.

Zoo, or Letters Not about Love is an epistolary novel born of this constraint, and although the brilliant and playful letters contained here cover everything from observations about contemporary German and Russian life to theories of art and literature, nonetheless every one of them is indirectly dedicated to the one topic they are all required to avoid: their author's own unrequited love.</p></p><p><p>Viktor Borisovich Shklovsky was a Russian and Soviet critic, writer, and pamphleteer.</p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Russian</p><h2>A Field Guide to Fossils of Texas (Gulf Publishing Field Guide Series)</h2><p><i>A Field Guide to Fossils of Texas</i> is the only definitive guide that presents a collection of the state's most common fossils and also shows the most important, noteworthy, and unusual specimens.</p><p>Finsley is curator emeritus of earth science at the Dallas Museum of Natural History.

But just what <i>is </i>the role of police in a democracy: to serve the public or to protect the powerful? Tracing the evolution of the modern police force back to the slave patrols, this controversial study observes the police as the armed defender of a violent status quo.</p><p> <b>Kristian Williams</b> is the author of <i>American Methods: Torture and the Logic of Domination.</i></p></p><p>Kristian Williams&#39;s writings have appeared in CounterPunch, Columbia Journalism Review, and We Are Everywhere: The Irresistible Rise of Global Anti-Capitalism. A member of Rose City Copwatch in Portland, Oregon, Williams also authored Our Enemies in Blue (2004).Sweeping generalizations and little nuance make self-described anarchist Williams's first book likely to appeal only to a preselected readership who will not be put off by the title and the oversimplified theme that police officers are inherently aggressive, racist and brutal tools of the powers that be. Williams, who has written for <i>Dissent</i> and the <i>Progressive,</i> traces the development of the American police from colonial times and Southern efforts to keep slaves in check. He's strongest in delineating the unintended consequences of well-intentioned efforts to reduce police corruption and brutality, but barely a page goes by without the voicing of extremist views (e.g., a New York PBA rally that became a riot against then-mayor David Dinkins, followed by the election of the police-friendly Rudolph Giuliani, is called a "municipal-level coup"). While the litany of police misdeeds&#x2014;ranging from collusion with the Klan to the shooting of unarmed Amadou Diallo&#x2014;makes plain that there has always been unjustified behavior by police, it doesn't prove his argument that nothing can be done to reform the force. His alternate proposal&#x2014;replacing a government force with a voluntary community patrol&#x2014;will strike many as na�ve in a post-9/11 world, and too rigid when he dismisses, as a form of co-optation, community policing, which has enabled officers to rely less on force. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He's been published for 40 years and has written and/or illustrated over 200 books, including 26 Fairmount Avenue, Strega Nona, and Meet the Barkers. Tomie dePaola and his work have been recognized with the Caldecott Honor Award, the Newbery Honor Award and the New Hampshire Governor's Arts Award of Living Treasure. He lives in New London, New Hampshire with his new Airedale dog, Bront�. <br>PreSchool-Grade 4-A retelling of the legend of St. Christopher. Because of his stature, Reprobus the giant wishes to serve the most powerful ruler in the world. During his travels, he meets a mighty king, the devil, and a hermit before understanding that it is Christ he must serve. To do so, the giant uses his impressive strength to carry travelers across a fast-flowing river. One stormy night, he risks his life to help a small child across. With each step, the river rises higher, the wind blows harder, and his passenger grows heavier. Finally safe on the other side, the child reveals that he is Jesus, and renames Reprobus Christopher, or "Bearer-of-Christ." dePaola uses his impressive storytelling skills to convey the action, describing miraculous events with simplicity and dignity. The illustrations, with their clean lines and carefully balanced presentation, are vintage dePaola. The giant's size, accentuated by his massive head and large hands, is gentled by his sorrowful eyes. The devil is depicted as a winged beast. The dramatic image of Reprobus, painfully doubled over as he struggles under his burden, suggests the power and mystery of medieval religious paintings. An author's note explains why Christopher was removed from the Catholic Church's Calendar of Saints. Religious debates aside, this story, with its fluently integrated text and illustrations, stands solidly on its own.<br><i>Joy Fleishhacker, New York Public Library</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>World War I (First Book)</h2><p>Provides an overview of the military battles and political changes that occurred during World War I</p><p></p><h2>Herbal Treasures: Inspiring Month-by-Month Projects for Gardening, Cooking, and Crafts</h2><p>A compendium of the best herb crafts, recipes, and gardening ideas. 186,000 copies in print.<p></p></p><p>Herbs are treasures indeed!

Its rolling hills and lush, fairy-tale scenery drew some of the nation's most gifted artists, including sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens, illustrator Maxfield Parrish, and architect Charles Platt. A PLACE OF BEAUTY celebrates this historic locale, highlighting the dazzling flower gardens and renowned landscapes and architecture that inspired the artists who called the colony home. Illustrated with paintings by the colony artists, sepia-toned photographs of the historic gardens, portraits of the major artists, and present-day photos depicting restored gardens and homes. Publication coincides with a major retrospective of Maxfield Parrish's work touring fine art museums across the country. Awards:2001 Quill &amp; Trowel Award Winner, Garden Writers Association of AmericaGold Medal Award, Massachusetts Horticultural Society</p><p>Much has changed since the previous turn of the century, but our appreciation of the restrained and peaceful beauty of Cornish, New Hampshire has remained. In the early 1900s, Cornish was renowned as an artist's colony filled with magical gardens that appeared in the work of many resident artists like Frances Houston, William Hyde, Maria Oakey Dewing, and Stephen and Maxfield Parrish. In many cases, the fame of the gardens outlasted the reputation of the artist, but in <i>A Place of Beauty</i>, the art and the gardens that provided inspiration are seen as inseparable.<p> Garden admirers will enjoy this book as much as any art historian. Twelve different houses are discussed in detail--the owners, architects, gardeners, and their stylistic goals are revealed through fascinating text, historical photographs, and reproductions of the works of art that were created by the talented residents. Between painting, sculpting, and writing, Cornish's residents also found time to be surprisingly competitive in the realm of gardening. While each house maintained a clear style, the overall beauty was discussed and judged with a fairly critical eye, and professional designers such as Ellen Shipman were brought in for expert consultations. As one visitor said, "They bore me to death with their houses and their poor little flower beds." The text is filled with personal notes, diary entries, and letters--the Cornish residents were a prolific lot. And while the community was described by one female citizen as "a place where men are acknowledged to be more important than the women," the numerous photos and reproductions of paintings that fill the book show a world filled with an astonishing beauty rarely seen in our modern world. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p>ALMA M.

She was first educated privately in India, and later at Blackheath School for Girls. Her first husband was George Dillon, with whom she had her only child, a daughter. She also had two stepsons from her first marriage, one of whom died in the Somme during World War I. Her first novel was published in 1910, but it wasn&#39;t until the 1920&#39;s that she embarked on her long career as a writer of mysteries. Her most famous creation was Miss Maud Silver, who appeared in 32 novels, though there were a further 33 full-length mysteries not featuring Miss Silver-the entire run of these is now reissued by Dean Street Press. Patricia Wentworth died in 1961. She is recognized today as one of the pre-eminent exponents of the classic British golden age mystery novel.</p><h2>Essays in Persuasion</h2><p><p><strong>The essays in this volume show Keynes's attempts to influence the course of events by public persuasion over the period of 1919-40.</strong></p> In the light of subsequent history, <em>Essays in Persuasion</em> is a remarkably prophetic volume covering a wide range of issues in political economy. In articles on the Versailles Treaty. John Maynard Keynes foresaw all too clearly that excessive Allied demands for reparations and indemnities would lead to the economic collapse of Germany. In Keynes's essays on inflation and deflation, the reader can find ideas that were to become the foundations of his most renowned treatise, <em>The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money</em> (1936). With startling accuracy Keynes forecast the economic fluctuations that were to beset the economies of Europe and the United States and even proposed measures which, if heeded at the time, might have warded off an era of world-wide depression. His views on Soviet Russia, on the decline of laissez-faire, and the possibilities of economic growth are as relevant today as when Keynes originally set them forth.</p><p>John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) was one of the greatest economic theorists of the twentieth century. He was chairman of the liberal journal of opinion The Nation and economics advisor for more than thirty years to British governments. He wrote several books, including his masterpiece, The General Theory of Employment, Essays in Persuasion, Interest and Money, the two-volume Treatise on Money, and A Tract on Monetary Reform.</p><h2>The Pilates Bible</h2><p><p><b>The most comprehensive and easily accessible guide to Pilates ever. </b> </p> <p>Participation in Pilates has skyrocketed by more than 500 percent in the last five years.

Engaged by their interior world, they&#x2019;re often regarded as aloof. Easily overwhelmed by too much stimulation, they can be seen as unmotivated. Content with just one or two close friends, they may be perceived as unpopular. Parents fret that they are unhappy and maladjusted. But the truth is quite different: Introverted children are creative problem solvers. Introverted children love to learn. Introverted children have a high EQ (emotional IQ) and are in touch with their feelings. They take time to stop and smell the roses, and they enjoy their own company. They are dependable, persistent, flexible, and lack vanity. <br><br> How can parents help their introverted children discover and cultivate these wonderful gifts? Help is here. Written by Dr. Marti Olsen Laney, author of <i>The Introvert Advantage</i> with 74,000 copies in print, <i>The Hidden Gifts of the Introverted Child </i>fully explains introversion as a hardwired temperament, not a disability, and tells just what parents need to do to help their child become the person he or she is meant to be&#x2014;and succeed in an extroverted world. Beginning with a 30-question quiz that places a child on the introvert/extrovert continuum, <i>The Hidden Gifts </i>shows parents how to foster a climate that allows introverted kids to discover their inner strengths; schedule ways for a very young innie to recharge those batteries and teach an older child to do it for him- or herself; create a harmonious household with siblings, and parents, of different temperaments; help innies find success at school, sports, parties, and other group activities.</p><p>Do you have a child who hangs back at birthday parties? Who dreads being called on in class? Who hugs the sidelines, and who surprises you by seeming withdrawn or aloof in public but turns into a chatterbox at home?<br><br> The plight of the introverted child is to be often misunderstood. Parents, siblings, classmates, teacher, and&#x2014;most devastatingly&#x2014;the child himself feel that there's something wrong with him. With <i>The Hidden Gifts of the Introverted Child</i>, Dr. Marti Olsen Laney brings wisdom and science together to provide parents with an essential guide to raising a successful, well-adjusted innie. It covers the hard-wired introvert temperament; introvert-extrovert family dynamics; navigating school, sports, and social life; and especilly, how to draw out your introvert's hidden gifts, which may include a love of learning, empathy, creativity, and flexibility&#x2014;virtues easily lost in the bluster of an extroverted world.Marti Olsen Laney, Psy.D., is a researcher, educator, author, and psychotherapist.

He lives in Sydney, Australia, with his wife and children.Grade 6&#x2013;9&#x2014;Arthur Penhaligon is having a bad week. Of course he is now "Lord Arthur, Rightful Heir to the Architect, Commander of the Army of the Architect, and a whole lot of other stuff" since defeating Sir Thursday, but his job certainly isn't any easier. Lady Friday has supposedly abandoned her claim to the Middle House, and she has challenged Arthur, the Piper, and Superior Saturday to find the Fifth Key and gain control of the Middle. Meanwhile, Arthur's friend Leaf has been captured by Lady Friday and is being used to lure Arthur into her trap. She has become obsessed with "Experiencing" mortal memories and is bent on taking as many humans as she can. As with other books in the series, this story is replete with characters that are good, bad, and ambiguous. The plot is complex, and readers need to read the four previous books to have any sense of what is going on in this one. As always, Nix's writing is witty and the plays on words are entertaining. The author gives just enough new information to keep the series' fans coming back for more, but he doesn't answer many questions.&#x2014;<i>Cheri Dobbs, Detroit Country Day Middle School, Beverly Hills, MI</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It is his Met years&#x2014;from apprentice carpenter to general manager&#x2014;that give us a story about New York and the business of culture. Volpe looks at the Met today, an institution full of vast egos and complicated politics, as well as its glittering past&#x2014;the old Met at Thirty-ninth and Broadway, and the political and artistic intrigues that exploded around its move to Lincoln Center. With stunning candor, he writes about the general managers he worked under, including Rudolf Bing and Anthony Bliss; his own embattled rise to the top; the maneuverings of the blue-chip board; his bad-cop, good-cop collaboration with the conductor James Levine; and his masterful approach to making a family of such highly charged artist-stars as Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo, Teresa Stratas, and Ren�e Fleming, and such visionary directors as Franco Zeffirelli, Robert Wilson, and Julie Taymor.</p><p>Joseph Volpe was born in Brooklyn. He joined the Metropolitan Opera in 1964 and has been its general manager for sixteen years. He lives in New York City with his wife, the former ballet dancer Jean Anderson Volpe, and their daughter.<br><br>Charles Michener was senior editor for cultural affairs at <i>Newsweek </i>and senior editor at <i>The New Yorker</i> and has written widely on music for many publications. He collaborated with Robert Evans on <i>The Kid Stays in the Picture</i> and was coauthor with Peter Duchin of <i>Ghost of a Chance</i>.1<br><br>&#x201c;BE PATIENT&#x201d;<br><br>My maternal grandmother, Marianna Cavallaro, spoke no English, and whenever she came to babysit for me and my sisters while our parents were out, she&#x2019;d go over to a shelf in the living room, take down a record album, and say to me in Italian, &#x201c;Joey, put this on.&#x201d;<br><br>I was only five or six, and carrying the bulky volume of 78s over to the Victrola wasn&#x2019;t easy. But I liked climbing up on a stool, removing a shiny black disc from its sleeve, hearing it plop into place, and then positioning the needle in the groove. My grandmother always sat in the same place&#x2014;an armchair with a straight back that made it impossible to slouch. She wanted me to sit nearby on the sofa, perfectly still. But I hated sitting still. Once the music started and my grandmother closed her eyes, I slid down to the floor, leaned against the sofa, and imagined myself somewhere else.<br><br>The music was always the same&#x2014;Mascagni&#x2019;s one-act opera <i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i>, which is set in a Sicilian village like the one from which my grandmother had come to America, not long after the opera was written, at the turn of the century. Nobody told me that this was &#x201c;opera.&#x201d; Even if anyone had, I wouldn&#x2019;t have paid attention. This music belonged to my grandmother. It made her happy. She always insisted on listening to the whole album&#x2014;there were perhaps eight or ten discs&#x2014;and she never fell asleep. I guess she picked that particular chair so she wouldn&#x2019;t miss a note.<br><br>I couldn&#x2019;t fall asleep either. Before I knew it, the needle had reached the center of the disc, the loud, scratchy voices had stopped, and my grandmother was saying quietly in Italian, &#x201c;Change the record, Joey.&#x201d;<br><br>Looking back, I find it interesting that my grandmother never asked my older sister, Joan, to participate in those musical s�ances&#x2014;this was a job only for me. Was she sending me a message? Was this how it all began?<br>The thought that I could one day run The Metropolitan Opera first crossed my mind when Rudolf Bing retired as general manager in 1972. At the time, I was still only master carpenter, in charge of the seventy or eighty men who set up and dismantled The Met&#x2019;s stage for every performance. I&#x2019;d wrestled with budgets. I&#x2019;d demonstrated a knack for learning quickly on the job. I was good at solving problems and handling emergencies. I felt I knew better than anyone how The Met worked, mechanically and logistically.<br><br>The Met is the biggest performing arts institution in the world. Every year it presents some 240 performances of thirty or so different operas, each with an international cast and elaborate sets. It employs more than two thousand people and has annual operating expenses of more than $220 million. To keep it going requires not just the muscle and the know-how of carpenters, stagehands, painters, designers, electricians, and prop men, but also the skills of musicians, singers, vocal coaches, dancers, ballet masters, stage directors, conductors, artistic administrators, marketing and publicity people, and the efforts of The Met&#x2019;s board of directors, which raises the funds to pay for what the box office doesn&#x2019;t. In 1972, I didn&#x2019;t really understand how many of those jobs were done. Nor did I have the slightest idea how Rudolf Bing had managed to coordinate everyone during the two decades he&#x2019;d been in charge.<br><br>Still, I thought that the top job at The Met&#x2014;which means the top job in the opera world&#x2014;was not out of reach. I felt that in some mysterious sense I&#x2019;d been chosen by Rudolf Bing himself. Not that he ever hinted as much. He was too much the aristocrat, out of a Viennese operetta. But on more than one occasion, he&#x2019;d taken me aside to offer advice in a way that suggested he had bigger things in mind for me.<br><br>One of our earliest encounters took place at the end of my first season as master carpenter. In those days, The Met went on an eight-week tour every spring. Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Memphis, Dallas, Minneapolis, Detroit&#x2014;for years the company had been playing to packed houses beyond the Hudson River. That year, we opened with <i>La Gioconda</i> in Atlanta. The stars were the soprano Renata Tebaldi and the tenor Franco Corelli. After the performance, Mr. Bing came backstage and said, &#x201c;Mr. Volpe, I&#x2019;d like to see you in the morning.&#x201d;<br><br>The next morning, he led me into one of the principals&#x2019; dressing rooms and closed the door. &#x201c;Mr. Volpe,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;re doing a wonderful job. I&#x2019;m going to give you a raise of fifty dollars a week.&#x201d; That came as a huge relief, but then he said, &#x201c;So how did Mr. Corelli do last night?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;How was his behavior backstage?&#x201d;<br><br>Before a performance, Franco Corelli was always a wreck, complaining that his girdle was too tight or fighting with his wife, Loretta, who never left his side until he was able to summon the courage to make his entrance. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t notice?&#x201d; Mr. Bing went on. &#x201c;Franco Corelli, one of the most important tenors in the world, and you didn&#x2019;t <i>notice</i>?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I guess I was too busy with the scenery.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Mr. Bing said, &#x201c;the next time I ask you about Mr. Corelli&#x2019;s behavior, you will have noticed!&#x201d;<br>Rudolf Bing had his finger on the pulse of The Met. His retirement, after the 1971&#x2013;1972 season, gave way to twenty years of turbulence. First came the death of his successor, Goeran Gentele, in a car crash in Sardinia. This was followed by a brief, rudderless period under Gentele&#x2019;s assistant, Schuyler Chapin. Next came the stormy triumvirate of John Dexter, the brilliant head of production; James Levine, the boy-wonder music director; and Anthony Bliss, a patrician estate lawyer who ran The Met out of a sense of family duty. Those years were marred by backstage intrigue, financial instability, and bitter fights with The Met&#x2019;s seventeen unions, culminating in the cancellation of the 1980 fall season&#x2014;a labor lockout ordered by The Met&#x2019;s imperious board. The brief reign of Levine as artistic director and of Bruce Crawford, a smooth, opera-loving advertising executive, as general manager, began in 1985. Bruce became something of a godfather to me. I admired his velvet manner, but it wasn&#x2019;t a style I would emulate.<br><br>Along the way, I&#x2019;d been promoted from master carpenter to technical director to operations director (responsible for backstage budgets and labor negotiations) to assistant manager (in charge of everything except artistic matters and fund-raising). None of these advancements came without an objection from someone higher up; in each case, I had to swallow my pride. But I had been at the center of everything&#x2014;watching, learning, and not keeping my mouth shut. In 1988, Crawford decided to return to Madison Avenue. I felt that I was his logical successor. Instead, The Met&#x2019;s board chose an arts bureaucrat named Hugh Southern whose only qualifications for running the company seemed to be that he&#x2019;d never seen the front office of a great opera house&#x2014;but he sported an English accent, courtesy of Cambridge University. Those qualifications turned out to be not quite enough. Southern was dismissed after seven months.<br><br>In the summer of 1990, Crawford, who was now the chairman of The Met&#x2019;s executive committee, came into my office to tell me that I was being promoted to &#x201c;general director.&#x201d; For a moment I was speechless. Then I snapped, &#x201c;Why not &#x2018;general manager&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br><br>Bruce explained that the board had decided to reinstate the triumvirate model of management. I would run the house internally. Jimmy Levine would remain artistic director. Marilyn Shapiro, who had been in charge of marketing and development, was now executive director for external affairs. We would all report to the president of the board, Louise Humphrey, a Cleveland heiress who had a plantation in Florida, a horse farm in Kentucky, and a summer compound in Maine. Hugh Southern had gone quail shooting at Louise&#x2019;s Florida spread. I&#x2019;d never shot a quail in my life.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe I shouldn&#x2019;t accept it,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Joe,&#x201d; Bruce said, &#x201c;it will all come to you in the end.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who gets the room at the end of the hall?&#x201d; I asked, referring to the office from where Rudolf Bing had reigned.<br><br>Bruce said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll stay where you are. The general manager&#x2019;s office will become a conference room.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s ridiculous,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It works perfectly well as a conference room right now&#x2014;with a real general manager behind the desk. It&#x2019;s like being asked to run The Met with one hand tied behind my back!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Trust me, Joe,&#x201d; Bruce said. &#x201c;It will all work out. Be patient.&#x201d;<br>I knew that my blunt manner had ruffled a few feathers on The Met&#x2019;s board. After one board meeting, Bruce had taken me aside and said, &#x201c;Joe, what you have to say is right. But it&#x2019;s the way you say it . . .&#x201d;<br><br>During the search that coughed up Southern, I&#x2019;d also heard that various board members were raising other objections about me. Would Volpe, the ex-carpenter, be able to talk to the singers? Would Volpe be able to &#x201c;represent&#x201d; The Met at gala fund-raising functions? Did Volpe have the right stuff . . . socially? Although my grandparents had come to America from the country where opera was born, I had never studied music. I didn&#x2019;t have a degree in arts management. I&#x2019;d barely graduated from high school.<br><br>Everything I knew about running an opera house I had figured out for myself, starting by using my hands. I&#x2019;d stayed at The Met for twenty-five years because I&#x2019;d come to love opera. The Met had been my undergraduate education, my graduate school, my Ph.D. program. I considered The Met &#x201c;family.&#x201d; Now I was supposed to take Bruce&#x2019;s advice: &#x201c;Be patient.&#x201d;<br><br>For someone like me, that wasn&#x2019;t going to be easy.<br>2<br><br>ALWAYS ON THE GO<br><br>In the den of my apartment in New York is a photograph of my parents&#x2019; wedding reception. The date is September 8, 1935. The setting is Trommer&#x2019;s banquet hall at 1632 Bushwick Avenue, in Brooklyn. There are several hundred people in the high-ceilinged main dining room&#x2014;the women with corsages, the men with slicked-down hair and dressed in double-breasted suits. At the head table are twenty-two people&#x2014;the bride and groom and their immediate families. My parents&#x2014;my mother in white satin, my father in white tie and tails&#x2014;look happy and proud. There isn&#x2019;t a blonde in sight.<br><br>And there isn&#x2019;t an empty place. A thousand people were invited, and when some of them didn&#x2019;t show up, my grandfather went outside and brought in strangers off the street. He wanted a full house. I would have done the same thing.<br><br>Basilio Cavallaro was born in 1881 in the mountain village of Cesar�, in Sicily. At the age of twenty-six he came to America, arriving at Ellis Island on March 17, 1907. Soon, he met and married my grandmother, Marianna Cerami, who had arrived the previous year from a similar Sicilian village, Petralia Soprana. They settled in Lower Manhattan, where my grandfather started a little storefront business that made men&#x2019;s clothing. Another family photograph shows the shop as it was in 1914. B. CAVALLARO TAILORING CO. the letters read, and in front of the store is my mother astride a pony&#x2014;one with a Sicilian pedigree, no doubt. My grandfather worked hard, enlarged his business, and in 1925 founded the Italian Coat Contractors Association, which eventually became the Greater Clothing Contractors Association, representing the interests of all the men&#x2019;s clothing manufacturers in New York.<br><br>My grandfather had highly placed friends among the police and politicians, especially Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, who was a frequent guest at the family&#x2019;s three-story brick house in Jamaica, Queens. The only memento I have of my grandfather is his Colt revolver. I grew up with stories about how it had come in handy when mobsters tried to muscle in on the men&#x2019;s clothing business.<br><br>My grandfather&#x2019;s house had a big front porch, two stone lions on guard, a dark walnut stairway, and a dining room that seemed to stretch for miles. At Sunday dinners, my grandfather stood at the head of the table and surveyed his family, which included more aunts than I could count. Among his eleven children was my mother, who was born on July 16, 1911. She was baptized Fortunata Angela Carmela Cavallaro. There were always at least twenty people seated around big bowls of pasta under stuffed pheasants mounted above the sideboard. My grandfather was an avid hunter, and his favorite hunting companion was his Irish setter, Red. When Red was accidentally shot and killed by another hunter, the wailing around that table went on for hours.<br><br>As a little girl, my mother&#x2014;like her mother&#x2014;spoke no English. When she started going to school she was made to sit in the corner and wear a dunce cap. She eventually went to Hunter College, where she earned a master&#x2019;s degree that enabled her to become a first-grade schoolteacher. Later, she taught in a predominantly black school in Glen Cove, Long Island, where she was known as a stickler for proper English. After my older sister was born, Mom wanted only English spoken in the house. No one could stop my father from speaking Italian. But Dad made it clear that none of his three children would learn Italian. After all, we were American.<br><br>My father&#x2019;s parents were immigrants from Avellino, a town outside Naples. I was named after my paternal grandfather, Joseph Michael Volpe, who was as quiet and reserved as my grandfather Basilio was outgoing and gregarious. For most of his life he had a tailor&#x2019;s shop in Red Bank, New Jersey. I remember very little about him or about my grandmother Nunziata, except that she was a great one for complaining about her health.<br><br>My father&#x2014;his given names were Michael Joseph&#x2014;was the oldest of five children. At a young age, he started Associated Clothing, which made men&#x2019;s suits and overcoats. Before long, he had a small factory at 142&#x2013;144 West Fourteenth Street, which had several hundred employees. (The building is now occupied by the Pratt Institute.) A few years later, he opened another factory in Atlantic City. My father did so well that he was able to pay the law school tuition of his favorite younger brother.<br><br>My uncle Joe went on to become an important Washington lawyer. He was the general counsel of the Tennessee Valley Authority and, later, the general counsel for the Atomic Energy Commission. In the latter job, he became a close adviser to J. Robert Oppenheimer, who led the team that built the first atomic bomb at Los Alamos. After the war, Uncle Joe was counsel to &#x201c;Oppie&#x201d; during the House Un-American Activities Committee hearings, at which the physicist was questioned about his prewar associations with the Communist Party. When Oppenheimer, who had a quick tongue, said something during a congressional hearing on atomic energy that made one of the commissioners, Lewis Strauss, look foolish, my uncle&#x2014;a very judicious man&#x2014;cautioned him to watch his mouth. When I grew older, Uncle Joe would have given me the same advice. Like Oppie, I probably wouldn&#x2019;t have taken it.</p><h2>Finding Merlin</h2><p>Merlin: the very name evokes intriguing images - magician, wise man, prophet, adviser to Arthur, counsellor of Camelot. The legend is famous but not the truth: that Merlin was a historical figure, a Briton, who hailed not from England or Wales, as traditional wisdom would have it, but from Scotland. Adam Ardrey brings back to life Merlin&#39;s role in the cataclysmic battles between reason and religion of sixth-century Britain - battles which Merlin would ultimately lose. From the time of his death up until the present day, historical records relating to Merlin have been altered, his true provenance and importance obscured and his name changed to mean &#39;Madman&#39;. The same fate awaited Merlin&#39;s twin sister, Languoreth, as intelligent and powerful as her brother but, as a woman, a greater threat to the power of church and state. Languoreth&#39;s existence was all but obliterated and her story lost - until now. &#34;Finding Merlin&#34; uncovers new evidence and re-examines the old. The places where Merlin was born, lived, died and was buried are identified, as well as the people surrounding him - his nemesis Mungo and his friend the hero Arthur. In this impressively well-researched and accessibly written book, Merlin walks from the pages of legend into history.</p><p>Adam Ardrey is an advocate and lives in Glasgow with his wife and three children. He was the first chairman of the Moira Anderson Foundation, a charity set up to combat the effects of child sex abuse, and has previously worked in television and as a solicitor.Drawing on what he claims has been a history of suppression by England's political and religious authorities, Scottish writer Ardrey says Merlin did indeed exist but that our image of him is a myth: Merlin wasn't a wizard and King Arthur's avuncular counselor but a revered scholar, politician and military commander in central Scotland in the late sixth and early seventh centuries. Merlin was a Celt, Ardrey claims, not an Anglo-Saxon, and was not Christian but adhered to the old ways of the druids, who sought to live harmoniously with others and with nature. Together with the great warlord Arthur Mac Aedan, son of the king of Scots, Merlin led the Britons and their Scots allies against the Angles. Ardrey takes aim at Mungo, Glasgow's patron saint and Merlin's archenemy, depicting him as the ruthlessly ambitious head of a group of Catholic fundamentalists akin to the twenty-first-century Taliban, whose exploits were distorted by his 12th-century hagiographer, Jocelyn of Furness. Merlin is an enticing biographical subject, but Ardrey's pedantic style, his dull dissection of Jocelyn, and his long-winded digressions into the cross-dressing of Mungo's father or why Merlin couldn't have built Stonehenge don't enhance his argument. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He decribes pagan oracles, festivals, and cultic practices as they related to civic and community life in third-century Roman Empire; then, comparing these with Christian practices, he discusses the possible reasons for Christianity's ultimate triumph. Along the way, certain misconceptions are dispelled: Roman paganism was not dying out, as is sometimes supposed, nor was early Christianity primarily a religion of slaves. In fact, the Church had elements that made it unexpectedly attractive to all classes. The chapter on Constantine gives new insight into the reasons for his conversion. An excellent and readable account of a fascinating subject. Highly recommended. C.

With two ex-wives, four Lincoln Town Cars that he uses as offices, and dozens of guilty clients, he can't afford to miss a trick. When he gets picked by a Beverly Hills rich boy arrested for assault, Mickey sees a franchise case: a nice, long, expensive trial with maximum billable hours--until it hurtles him into the last place he wants to be. Suddenly hustling, cynical Mickey Haller is confronted with pure evil and someone who may be truly innocent. Now, for a lawyer who has always gone for the easy score, getting justice means taking the deadliest risk of all.</strong></p><p>This #1 bestselling legal thriller from Michael Connelly is a stunning display of novelistic mastery - as human, as gripping, and as whiplash-surprising as any novel yet from the writer <em>Publishers Weekly</em> has called "today's Dostoevsky of crime literature."<br><br>Mickey Haller is a Lincoln Lawyer, a criminal defense attorney who operates out of the backseat of his Lincoln Town Car, traveling between the far-flung courthouses of Los Angeles to defend clients of every kind. Bikers, con artists, drunk drivers, drug dealers - they're all on Mickey Haller's client list. For him, the law is rarely about guilt or innocence, it's about negotiation and manipulation. Sometimes it's even about justice.<br><br>A Beverly Hills playboy arrested for attacking a woman he picked up in a bar chooses Haller to defend him, and Mickey has his first high-paying client in years. It is a defense attorney's dream, what they call a franchise case. And as the evidence stacks up, Haller comes to believe this may be the easiest case of his career. Then someone close to him is murdered and Haller discovers that his search for innocence has brought him face-to-face with evil as pure as a flame. To escape without being burned, he must deploy every tactic, feint, and instinct in his arsenal - this time to save his own life.<br> <p><strong>Q&amp;A with Michael Connelly</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Q:</strong> <i>The Lincoln Lawyer</i> is your second book to be made into a movie. How does that feel?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> I am very fortunate to have this experience even once. I wish every writer got a chance to see the written work translated to the visual. It is quite thrilling.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> You&#x2019;ve said that Matthew McConaughey nails the character of Mickey Haller. In what ways?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> I would say it is in many subtle ways that add up to a big performance. Mickey is a guy who is always looking for an angle. He is a bit cynical and cocky. At different times in the movie McConaughey seems to convey these character aspects without dialogue. Then when it comes to dialogue and action he delivers flawlessly. The story is about a cool, calm man being put into a desperate situation. McConaughey makes that leap convincingly.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What was your involvement in the making of the movie?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Almost none. I looked at the first and last versions of the script, took a few phone calls from producers and location scouts, and that was about it. I think my biggest contribution outside of writing the book was giving my trust to Tom Rosenberg and Gary Lucchesi, the producers. They promised me six years ago that they would keep the gritty realism of the story &#x2013; the-law-in-the-trenches aspect of it. I trusted them to do that and with Brad Furman, the director, they came through.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What were your immediate thoughts when you first read the script? When you heard about each cast member?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Depends on which script. It was a long-running work in progress. I went from not liking the first effort to being blown away by the last version. I am a huge believer in rewriting in my own work so I knew that the more time they spent with the script, the better it would become. As far as casting goes, I don't write with anybody in mind. But I saw <i>Tropic Thunder</i> with Matthew McConaughey in it and immediately thought he would be good at being Mickey Haller. A year later he was cast, so I was happy from the start. The rest of the cast is just fantastic. As each was announced, I became more and more excited. John Leguizamo was in Brad Furman's previous film and was just excellent. When I heard he was aboard, it was a great day. Same with all the rest. Bryan Cranston happens to be the star of my favorite show, <i>Breaking Bad</i>. So I couldn't be happier with him in the cast.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What was your inspiration for <i>The Lincoln Lawyer</i>? Is Mickey Haller based on someone you know?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> I met an attorney who worked out of his car, not because he was not doing well but because he believed it was the best way to do the job in L.A. That was the spark, and it went from there.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Are there any scenes in the film that you wish were in the book?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> There are definitely a few lines I wish were in the book. There is a scene where Mickey drops his sleeping daughter off at his ex-wife's home. It is a poignant scene that I really love and could have used in the book.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Did you visit the set while they were filming the movie? What was that experience like?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> I went four different times and scheduled the visits to coincide with the shooting of some significant scenes. I loved what I was seeing on both sides of the camera: a lot of dedication to the project. Everyone on the crew felt like they were making something good. It was great to witness.</p>Michael Connelly is a former journalist and has won every major prize for crime fiction.

In it, Gilles Deleuze and F�lix Guattari set forth the following theory: Western society's innate herd instinct has allowed the government, the media, and even the principles of economics to take advantage of each person's unwillingness to be cut off from the group. What's more, those who suffer from mental disorders may not be insane, but could be individuals in the purest sense, because they are by nature isolated from society. More than twenty-five years after its original publication, <i>Anti-Oedipus</i> still stands as a controversial contribution to a much-needed dialogue on the nature of free thinking.</p><p>This is an essential text for feminists, literary theorists, social scientists, philosophers, and others interested in the problems of contemporary Western culture.<b>Gilles Deleuze</b>&nbsp;was a prolific French philosopher and author of 25 books. A self-described "pure metaphysician," he was a professor of philosophy at the University of Paris VIII and was known for a style that forced readers to reevaluate their philosophical assumptions. Deleuze,&nbsp;along with close friend and colleague Feliz Guattari, wrote a two-volume work on anti-psychoanalytic social philosophy called <i>Capitalism and Schizophrenia</i>. The first volume, <i>Anti-Oedipus, </i>is their best-known work.<br><br><b>Felix Guattari</b> was a French psychiatrist and philosopher. He founded the Society for Institutional Psychotherapy in 1965 and the Centre for Institutional Studies and Research in 1970. Trained as a psychoanalyst, he, along with close friend and colleague Gilles Deleuze, were instrumental figures in the anti-psychiatry movement, which challenged established viewpoints in psychoanalysis, philosophy, and sociology. The two wrote a two-volume work on anti-psychoanalytic social philosophy called <i>Capitalism and Schizophrenia</i>. The first volume, <i>Anti-Oedipus,</i> is their best-known work.<br><br><b>Michel Foucault,&nbsp;</b>one of the leading philosophical thinkers of the 20th century,&nbsp;was born in Poitiers, France, in 1926.

Its thin fabric hung loosely on my frame, thanks to punishing daily workouts and a scrupulously fat-free diet, but I felt uncomfortably warm. Perched on the windowsill of our fourth-floor apartment, I dangled my legs in the fresh air. I couldn&#x2019;t believe it was late October. Milwaukee was usually chillier by now, already beginning its slouch toward the interminable Wisconsin winter. I felt the sun baking my face and legs, still bronze from dutiful visits to the tanning salon. The bright, hot rays made me squint and squirm. I didn&#x2019;t want to be here.<br><br>I had just come home from the night before and was suffering the start of a monster hangover. My head throbbed and my itchy skin begged for a shower. Tom Petty was wailing from the stereo speakers: I&#x2019;m tired of myself/Tired of this town. In the parking lot below, I spotted empty beer bottles and stray partiers trudging home from after-hours revelry and drunken couplings.<br><br>Behind me, a couple of my still-drunk college roommates were singing and dancing like banshees before the large open windows in our living room. The place stank of stale beer and cigarettes from a party we had thrown the first week of our junior year and from the many rowdy weekends that had followed. Although we were only two months into the fall semester, our brand-new apartment complex already bore vomit stains on its hallway rugs and fist-sized holes in its plaster walls&#x2014;proof of how most of its student tenants spent their weekends.<br><br>I liked this vantage point, looking down from a distant perch. It made me feel removed from the chaos. I always had felt somewhat separate from the campus party scene, even as I indulged in many of its pleasures. I was a scholarship student carrying a near-perfect GPA, on track to land a prestigious summer internship in Washington, DC, and serving as editor-in-chief of the campus magazine. I had a r�sum� packed with honor society memberships and evidence of a properly raised social consciousness.<br><br>As for the Catholic faith that had dominated my life in elementary and high school, well, that had taken a backseat to other priorities. I still considered myself a better-than-average Catholic. Since my freshman year, I had been active in all the right social justice organizations, devoting at least one afternoon or evening each week to busing tables at a nearby homeless shelter or feeding vagrants through a campus meals-on-wheels program. I attended Mass every Sunday. When it came to sex, I abided by the letter of the law I had been taught in my Catholic home&#x2014;no sex outside marriage&#x2014;though not its spirit. My true zeal was reserved for more concrete concerns, like obsessing over my body to make sure I stayed thin and fit. Unlike the other party girls who devoured late-night pizzas and hid their beer guts under loose-fitting flannel, I told myself, I was in control.<br><br>But lately my pride at compartmentalizing my life so completely&#x2014;being a good girl on Sunday morning and a wild one on Saturday night&#x2014;had begun to give way to something new, a dawning realization that I was as immersed in the chaos as anyone. Maybe I was even worse, because I was leading a double life. At least the potbellied partiers down the hall were consistent. They were not spending their lives keeping up appearances and juggling personas, playing the role of perfectionist honor student for one crowd and reckless reveler for another.<br><br>Looking back over my shoulder into our apartment, I saw my roommates sprawled on the couch, now drowsy and listless after a long night of carousing. I realized that living with them, and living like them, no longer made me happy. Nor did my relationship with the brooding rugby player who routinely rounded up his friends to meet me at whatever bar my friends and I were patronizing that night. I could not call our random meetings dates, and I could not call him my boyfriend. There were no names for such romantic entanglements, no rules of engagement, and most of the time my friends and I had no idea what to make of the men in our lives. We were unconstrained by customs of courtship or social norms. We could do whatever we wanted. Yet the awkwardness, confusion, and disappointment that marked our encounters with men made me wonder: Was our unfettered freedom just a trap in disguise?<br><br>This was not what I had envisioned when I set off for college. I had thought I would spend my Saturday nights discussing Aquinas over coffee and dating the kind of men who send roses, open car doors, and pay for dinner. I ran into a few of those men during my college years, but I had become so inured to the anti-dating ethos of campus life by then that I quickly dropped them and rejoined my friends on the party circuit.<br><br>Returning my gaze to the bleak scene beneath my window, I realized how much things had changed&#x2014;how much I<i> </i>had changed&#x2014;since I first arrived at my freshman dorm that muggy August move-in day. I had lost something. I didn&#x2019;t know what it was or how to get it back. I only knew that this aching emptiness in the pit of my stomach had grown unbearable.<br><br>Suddenly aware that I was shivering, I swung my legs back into the living room. I stood up, slammed the window shut, and strode past my roommates, now sleeping soundly despite the earsplitting music.<br><br>It was time to shower, to eat, to put on something warmer.<br><br>It was time for a change.</p><h2>Winter Holiday</h2><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>'You know what it's like.

He went to Russia in 1913 to study folklore and in 1914, at the start of World War I he became a foreign correspondent for the <i>Daily News</i>. In 1917 when the Russian Revolution began he became a journalist and was a special correspondent of the <i>Guardian</i>. He played chess with Lenin and married Trotsky's personal secretary, Evgenia Petrovna Shelepina. On their return to England, he bought a cottage near Windermere in the Lake District and began writing children's stories. In a 1958 author's note, Ransome wrote: ''I have been often asked how I came to write <i>Swallows and Amazons</i>. The answer is that it had its beginning long, long ago when, as children, my brother, my sisters and I spent most of our holidays on a farm at the south end of Coniston. We played in or on the lake or on the hills above... Going away from it we were half drowned in tears. While away from it, as children and as grown-ups, we dreamt about it. No matter where I was, wandering about the world, I used at night to look for the North Star and, in my mind's eye, could see the beloved sky-line of great hills beneath it. <i>Swallows</i> grew out of those old memories. I could not help writing it. It almost wrote itself.'' He published the first of his children's classics, the 12 <i>Swallows and Amazons</i> books, in 1930. In 1936 he won the first ever Carnegie Medal for his book, <i>Pigeon Post</i>.

This question was posed to thousands of cartoon fans, historians, and animators to create <i>The 100 Greatest Looney Tunes Cartoons,</i> the definitive <i>Looney Tunes</i> collection. Evaluated on their comedic brilliance, innovative animation, historical significance, and creative merit, cartoon historian Jerry Beck and the <i>Cartoon Brew</i> team of animation experts reveal the amusing anecdotes and secret origins behind such classics as What&#x2019;s Opera, Doc?,&#x201d; One Froggy Evening,&#x201d; and Duck Dodgers in the 24�th Century.&#x201d; Featuring more than 300 pieces of original art from private collectors and the Warner Bros. archives, <i>The 100 Greatest Looney Tunes Cartoons</i> settles the debate on the best of the best, and poses a new question: Is your favorite one of the greatest?</p><p>Jerry Beck is the author of over fifteen books on animation history.

During his recovery, his father gave him oil paints, a couple of brushes, and a small canvas. He painted a clown with colors straight from the tube. Tim&#39;s first work was promptly framed, and his love of painting was born.Ages 4-8. The love, fear, and faith of one of the most beautiful psalms find expression in a picture book set in a contemporary urban neighborhood. Glowing, realistic paintings of two African American children in a warm extended family illustrate the lines of the psalm, taking the kids through one day from early morning to night. The children wake in a joyful, loving home ("The Lord is my shepherd"); have fun with their friends in the playground; receive devoted attention from their teachers ("He guides me in paths of righteousness"); and return to food and shelter ("You prepare a table before me"). But the scene is bleak. They must walk to school and back through "the valley of the shadow of death," where menacing figures lounge in wait in shadowy, crowded streets. While they eat dinner in the light, the darkness outside their window is filled with violence. The slightly modernized text is less poetic than the King James Version. The pages are so tightly bound that you miss part of the middle of each double-page-spread illustration, and that's too bad because the pictures make extraordinary use of light and perspective, showing that the children are being watched with loving attention. In a final painting, they are asleep, the window above their bed transformed into a stained-glass vision of the Lord who is their shepherd. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>Steamboats on the Western Rivers: An Economic and Technological History (Dover Maritime)</h2><p>Definitive account covers every aspect of steamboat&#39;s development: its construction, equipment and operation; the organization and conduct of steamboat transportation as a business enterprise; the hazards and amenities of shipboard life; steamboat races on the Mississippi and Ohio rivers; collisions, explosions and fires; the rise of competition; the ultimate decline, and much more.</p><p></p><h2>Isabelle (American Girl, 1)</h2><p>Isabelle is excited about starting her first year at the Anna Hart School of the Arts!

And many of them write exceedingly well. In this thoughtful, personal, and embracing consideration of garden writing, garden historian Elizabeth Barlow Rogers selects and discusses the best of these writers. She makes her case by picking delightful examples that span two centuries, arranging the writers by what they did and how they saw themselves: nurserymen, foragers, conversationalists, philosophers, humorists, etc. Her discussions and appreciations of these diverse personalities are enhanced and supported by informed appraisals of their talents, obsessions, and idiosyncrasies, and by extensive extracts from their writings. Rogers provides historical background, anecdotal material, and insight into how these garden writers worked. And wherever appropriate, she illustrates her story with images from their books, so you can not only read what they wrote but also see what they were describing. Since gardens are by their very nature ephemeral, these visual clues from the pages of their books, many reproduced in color, are as close as we will come to the originals.<br><br>What makes Writing the Garden such a joy to read is that it is not simply a collection of extracts, but real discussions and examinations of the personalities who made their mark on how we design, how we plant, and how we think about what is for many one of life's lasting pleasures. Starting with "Women in the Garden" (Jane Loudon, Frances Garnet Wolseley, and Gertrude Jekyll) and concluding with "Philosophers in the Garden" (Henry David Thoreau, Michael Pollan, and Allen Lacy), this is a book that encompasses the full sweep of the best garden writing in the English language. <br><br>Writing the Garden is co-published by the New York Society Library and the Foundation for Landscape Studies in association with David R. Godine, Publisher.<br><br>Winner of a 2012 American Horticultural Society Book Award!</p><p>Elizabeth Barlow Rogers is the president of the Foundation for Landscape Studies. A resident of New York City since 1964, Rogers was the first person to hold the title of Central Park Administrator, and she was the founding president of the Central Park Conservancy. The co-author of Romantic Gardens: Nature, Art, and Landscape Design (Godine, 2010), Rogers has won numerous awards for her work as a writer and landscape preservationist.Published to accompany an exhibit at the New York Society Library, this anthology offers a delightful introduction to more than 40 classic garden writers. Rogers (Landscape Design: A Cultural and Architectural History), a legendary park preservationist best-known for her work championing the renovation of New York's Central Park, offers thoughtful selections from 200 years of garden writing. There are nurserymen, novelists, humorists, philosophers, statesmen, and journalists in this eclectic group. Some members of this pantheon, such as Thomas Jefferson and Edith Wharton, will be familiar to all readers. Others, such as Beverley Nichols, may be known only to true gardening cognoscenti. All are masters of this literary genre. Rogers provides an intimate and illuminating introduction to each writer, highlighting the special appeal, idiosyncratic perspectives, and delightful charms of each. She has also included photographs and drawings from their original works. This is an anthology that will pique any garden lover's interest in further reading. --Publishers Weekly<br><br>Rogers is not only a garden writer and landscape preservationist but also a bibliophile. In putting together this artfully produced collection of knowledgeable yet "informal, engaging, and sometimes droll" British and American garden literature, Rogers drew on her own collection and that of the New York Society Library, reveling in the pleasures of rare books. Rogers does share colorful cuttings from the writings of 42 eloquent master gardeners past and present, but her mission is primarily biographical. In a book lushly illustrated with watercolors by Childe Hassam, plates from first editions, and photographs, Rogers vividly, wittily, and incisively profiles such narrating horticulture exemplars as Thomas Jefferson; Gertrude Jekyll, for whom "gardening was horticultural picture making"; William Robinson, who was "sometimes colorfully caustic"; nurseryman Andrew Jackson Downing; Celia Thaxter, a lighthouse-keeper's daughter and a poet as well as a gardener; the "urbanely quirky, humorously serious" Katherine S. White; and Michael Pollan, who sees the garden as a middle ground, where nature and culture are both enriched. In all, a vital, delectable, and illuminating retrospective of an essential branch of letters. --Booklist<br><br>This wonderful book is full of gardeners active, observant, opinionated.

But if you&#39;re looking for an intentional, God-pleasing game plan for finding a future spouse, Joshua Harris delivers an appealing one. A compelling new foreword, an all-new &#34;8 Great Courtship Conversations&#34; section, and updated material throughout makes this five-year revision of the original Boy Meets Girl a must-have! Harris illustrates how biblical courtship - a healthy, joyous alternative to recreational dating - worked for him and his wife. Boy Meets Girl presents an inspiring, practical example for readers wanting to pursue the possibility of marriage with someone they may be serious about.</p><p>Joshua Harris follows up his bestselling <i>I Kissed Dating Goodbye</i> with <i>Boy Meets Girl</i>, the story of how he met and married his wife, Shannon. Where Harris's first book encouraged readers to throw off modern ideas of romantic fixation, <i>Boy Meets Girl</i> goes to the next level and urges single Christian men and women to pursue courtship, and ultimately marriage, thoughtfully and prayerfully. Knowing that many readers will balk at the idea of premeditated courtship, Harris insists that dating should not be emotional recreation but rather a careful decision rooted in obedience to God. While the anecdotes used to reveal true-to-life scenarios about dating pitfalls are somewhat elementary (and geared to those in their 20s), Harris succeeds in hammering home the point that obedience to God's word, selfless love, community, purity, and satisfaction in God are the most important aspect of any relationship. The last section of the book is particularly practical, discussing forgiveness of past sexual sin, questions to ask before tying the knot, and how an understanding of our sinful nature can lead to conflict resolution. For Harris's mere twentysomething years of life experience, his maturity and devotion to God are sincere evidence that he has indeed practiced what he has preached, resulting in a passionate relationship with the love of his life. <i>--Jill Heatherly</i>Joshua Harris lives outside Washing-ton , D.C. , in Gaithersburg , Maryland , where he is senior pastor at Covenant Life Church .

While it inevitably includes tales of science fiction and fantasy including Martians transmuting into Christ figures, deserted worlds, and witches in New York, readers will also be surprised to find a mixture of mainstream fiction. Bradbury includes stories paying homage to Ernest Hemingway ("The Parrot Who Met Papa") and George Bernard Shaw ("G.B.S.-Mark V"). Michael Prichard performs many of the stories well, with competent pacing, tone, and distinct voices. However, throughout a good deal of Prichard's readings, there's an underlying restraint--at times, it even sounds if he's clenching his jaw. Still, the collection will provide fans with some great stories from several different genres. (Aug.) (c) <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Fashion's greatest designers and designs are all here: from Worth's visiting dress, Chanel's suits, Balenciaga's classic gowns, Dior's New Look, and Mary Quant's mini-dresses to recent designs from the collections of Calvin Klein, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Gucci, and others.<br><br> Photography could never capture so faithfully the dazzling variety of these designs. Indeed, many that predate the advent of color photography have never been shown in their original colors. John Peacock's wide-ranging research, using paintings, photographs, and the garments themselves, has allowed him to reproduce in meticulous detail lines, shapes, weaves, patterns, and colors. Arranged by decade, the drawings are accompanied by complete descriptions of each garment and accessory, including the fabric, cut, and pattern.<br><br> In this revised edition of Peacock's standard book, 155 new drawings have been added, together with detailed descriptions. The updated reference section includes a time chart summarizing the development of fashion, biographies of couturiers and designers, and a bibliography.

Dan Brown has written a thriller for those of us who like our hardware with disc drives and who rate our heroes by big brainpower rather than big firepower. It's an Internet user's spy novel where the good guys and bad guys struggle over secrets somewhat more intellectual than just where the secret formula is hidden--they have to gain understanding of what the secret formula actually is.<p> In this case, the secret formula is a new means of encryption, capable of changing the balance of international power. Part of the fun is that the book takes the reader along into an understanding of encryption technologies. You'll find yourself better understanding the political battles over such real-life technologies as the Clipper Chip and PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) software even though the book looks at the issues through the eyes of fiction.</p><p> Although there's enough globehopping in this book for James Bond, the real battleground is cyberspace, because that's where the "bomb" (or rather, the new encryption algorithm) will explode. Yes, there are a few flaws in the plot if you look too closely, but the cleverness and the sheer fun of it all more than make up for them. There are enough twists and turns to keep you guessing and a lot of high, gee-whiz-level information about encryption, code breaking, and the role they play in international politics. Set aside the whole afternoon and evening for it and have finger food on hand for supper--you may want to read this one straight through.</p>Praise for Dan Brown and <i>Digital Fortress</i>:<br><br>"A new master of smart thrills."<br>- <i>People</i><br><br>"<i>Digital Fortress</i> is the best and most realistic techno-thriller to reach the market in years.

With no wind in sight and his crew disabled by malaria, the narrator discovers that the medicine necessary to save the sick men is missing and its absence has been deliberately concealed. Meanwhile, his increasingly frightened first mate is convinced that the malignant ghost of the previous captain has cursed them. Suspenseful, atmospheric, and deceptively simple, Conrad&#x2019;s tale of the sea reflects the complex themes of his most famous novels, <i>Lord Jim </i>and <i>Heart of Darkness. </i></p><p><b>Joseph Conrad</b> was born Jozef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski in the Russian part of Poland in 1857. His parents were punished by the Russians for their Polish nationalist activities and both died while Conrad was still a child. In 1874 he left Poland for France and in 1878 he began a career with the Britsh merchant navy. He spent nearly twenty years as a sailor before becoming a full-time novelist. He became a British citizen in 1886 and settled permanentlyin England after his marriage in 1896.IOnly the young have such moments. I don&#39;t mean the very young. No. The very young have, properly speaking, no moments. It is the privilege of early youth to live in advance of its days in all the beautiful continuity of hope which knows no pauses and no introspection.One closes behind one the little gate of mere boyishness--and enters an enchanted garden. Its very shades glow with promise. Every turn of the path has its seduction. And it isn&#39;t because it is an undiscovered country. One knows well enough that all mankind had streamed that way. It is the charm of universal experience from which one expects an uncommon or personal sensation--a bit of one&#39;s own.One goes on recognising the landmarks of the predecessors, excited, amused, taking the hard luck and the good luck together--the kicks and the halfpence, as the saying is--the picturesque common lot that holds so many possibilities for the deserving or perhaps for the lucky. Yes. One goes on. And the time, too, goes on--till one perceives ahead a shadow-line warning one that the region of early youth, too, must be left behind.This is the period of life in which such moments of which I have spoken are likely to come. What moments? Why, the moments of boredom, of weariness, of dissatisfaction. Rash moments. I mean moments when the still young are inclined to commit rash actions, such as getting married suddenly or else throwing up a job for no reason.This is not a marriage story. It wasn&#39;t so bad as that with me. My action, rash as it was, had more the character of divorce--almost of desertion. For no reason on which a sensible person could put a finger I threw up my job--chucked my berth--left the ship of which the worst that could be said was that she was a steamship and therefore, perhaps, not entitled to that blind loyalty which . . . However, it&#39;s no use trying to put a gloss on what even at the time I myself half suspected to be a caprice.It was in an Eastern port. She was an Eastern ship, inasmuch as then she belonged to that port. She traded among dark islands on a blue reef-scarred sea, with the Red Ensign over the taffrail and at her masthead a house-flag, also red, but with a green border and with a white crescent in it. For an Arab owned her, and a Syed at that. Hence the green border on the flag. He was the head of a great House of Straits Arabs, but as loyal a subject of the complex British Empire as you could find east of the Suez Canal. World politics did not trouble him at all, but he had a great occult power amongst his own people.It was all one to us who owned the ship. He had to employ white men in the shipping part of his business, and many of those he so employed had never set eyes on him from the first to the last day. I myself saw him but once, quite accidentally on a wharf--an old, dark little man blind in one eye, in a snowy robe and yellow slippers. He was having his hand severely kissed by a crowd of Malay pilgrims to whom he had done some favour, in the way of food and money. His alms-giving, I have heard, was most extensive, covering almost the whole Archipelago. For isn&#39;t it said that &#34;The charitable man is the friend of Allah&#34;?Excellent (and picturesque) Arab owner, about whom one needed not to trouble one&#39;s head, a most excellent Scottish ship--for she was that from the keel up--excellent sea-boat, easy to keep clean, most handy in every way, and if it had not been for her internal propulsion, worthy of any man&#39;s love; I cherish to this day a profound respect for her memory. As to the kind of trade she was engaged in and the character of my shipmates, I could not have been happier if I had had the life and the men made to my order by a benevolent Enchanter.And suddenly I left all this. I left it in that, to us, inconsequential manner in which a bird flies away from a comfortable branch. It was as though all unknowing I had heard a whisper or seen something. Well--perhaps! One day I was perfectly right and the next everything was gone--glamour, flavour, interest, contentment--everything. It was one of these moments, you know. The green sickness of late youth descended on me and carried me off. Carried me off that ship, I mean.We were only four white men on board, with a large crew of Kalashes and two Malay petty officers. The Captain stared hard as if wondering what ailed me. But he was a sailor, and he, too, had been young at one time. Presently a smile came to lurk under his thick iron-grey moustache, and he observed that, of course, if I felt I must go he couldn&#39;t keep me by main force. And it was arranged that I should be paid off the next morning. As I was going out of the chart-room he added suddenly, in a peculiar wistful tone, that he hoped I would find what I was so anxious to go and look for. A soft, cryptic utterance which seemed to reach deeper than any diamond-hard tool could have done. I do believe he understood my case.But the second engineer attacked me differently. He was a sturdy young Scot, with a smooth face and light eyes. His honest red countenance emerged out of the engine-room companion and then the whole robust man, with shirt sleeves turned up, wiping slowly the massive fore-arms with a lump of cotton-waste. And his light eyes expressed bitter distaste, as though our friendship had turned to ashes. He said weightily: &#34;Oh! Aye! I&#39;ve been thinking it was about time for you to run away home and get married to some silly girl.&#34;It was tacitly understood in the port that John Nieven was a fierce mysogynist; and the absurd character of the sally convinced me that he meant to be nasty--very nasty--had meant to say the most crushing thing he could think of. My laugh sounded deprecatory. Nobody but a friend could be so angry as that. I became a little crestfallen. Our chief engineer also took a characteristic view of my action, but in a kindlier spirit.He was young, too, but very thin, and with a mist of fluffy brown beard all round his haggard face. All day long, at sea or in harbour, he could be seen walking hastily up and down the after-deck, wearing an intense, spiritually rapt expression, which was caused by a perpetual consciousness of unpleasant physical sensations in his internal economy. For he was a confirmed dyspeptic. His view of my case was very simple. He said it was nothing but deranged liver. Of course! He suggested I should stay for another trip and meantime dose myself with a certain patent medicine in which his own belief was absolute. &#34;I&#39;ll tell you what I&#39;ll do. I&#39;ll buy you two bottles, out of my own pocket. There. I can&#39;t say fairer than that, can I?&#34;I believe he would have perpetrated the atrocity (or generosity) at the merest sign of weakening on my part. By that time, however, I was more discontented, disgusted, and dogged than ever. The past eighteen months, so full of new and varied experience, appeared a dreary, prosaic waste of days. I felt--how shall I express it?--that there was no truth to be got out of them.What truth? I should have been hard put to it to explain. Probably, if pressed, I would have burst into tears simply. I was young enough for that.Next day the Captain and I transacted our business in the Harbour Office. It was a lofty, big, cool, white room, where the screened light of day glowed serenely. Everybody in it--the officials, the public--were in white. Only the heavy polished desks gleamed darkly in a central avenue, and some papers lying on them were blue. Enormous punkahs sent from on high a gentle draught through that immaculate interior and upon our perspiring heads.The official behind the desk we approached grinned amiably and kept it up till, in answer to his perfunctory question, &#34;Sign off and on again?&#34; my Captain answered, &#34;No! Signing off for good.&#34; And then his grin vanished in sudden solemnity. He did not look at me again till he handed me my papers with a sorrowful expression, as if they had been my passports for Hades.While I was putting them away he murmured some question to the Captain, and I heard the latter answer good-humouredly:&#34;No. He leaves us to go home.&#34;&#34;Oh!&#34; the other exclaimed, nodding mournfully over my sad condition.I didn&#39;t know him outside the official building, but he leaned forward over the desk to shake hands with me, compassionately, as one would with some poor devil going out to be hanged; and I am afraid I performed my part ungraciously, in the hardened manner of an impenitent criminal.No homeward-bound mail-boat was due for three or four days. Being now a man without a ship, and having for a time broken my connection with the sea--become, in fact, a mere potential passenger--it would have been more appropriate perhaps if I had gone to stay at a hotel. There it was, too, within a stone&#39;s throw of the Harbour Office, low, but somehow palatial, displaying its white, pillared pavilions surrounded by trim grass plots. I would have felt a passenger indeed in there! I gave it a hostile glance and directed my steps towards the Officers&#39; Sailors&#39; Home.I walked in the sunshine, disregarding it, and in the shade of the big trees on the esplanade without enjoying it. The heat of the tropical East descended through the leafy boughs, enveloping my thinly-clad body, clinging to my rebellious discontent, as if to rob it of its freedom.The Officers&#39; Home was a large bungalow with a wide verandah and a curiously suburban-looking little garden of bushes and a few trees between it and the street. That institution partook somewhat of the character of a residential club, but with a slightly Governmental flavour about it, because it was administered by the Harbour Office. Its manager was officially styled Chief Steward. He was an unhappy, wizened little man, who if put into a jockey&#39;s rig would have looked the part to perfection. But it was obvious that at some time or other in his life, in some capacity or other, he had been connected with the sea. Possibly in the comprehensive capacity of a failure.I should have thought his employment a very easy one, but he used to affirm for some reason or other that his job would be the death of him some day. It was rather mysterious. Perhaps everything naturally was too much trouble for him. He certainly seemed to hate having people in the house.On entering it I thought he must be feeling pleased. It was as still as a tomb. I could see no one in the living rooms; and the verandah, too, was empty, except for a man at the far end dozing prone in a long chair. At the noise of my footsteps he opened one horribly fish-like eye. He was a stranger to me. I retreated from there, and, crossing the dining-room--a very bare apartment with a motionless punkah hanging over the centre table--I knocked at a door labelled in black letters: &#34;Chief Steward.&#34;The answer to my knock being a vexed and doleful plaint: &#34;Oh, dear! Oh, dear! What is it now?&#34; I went in at once.It was a strange room to find in the tropics. Twilight and stuffiness reigned in there. The fellow had hung enormously ample, dusty, cheap lace curtains over his windows, which were shut. Piles of cardboard boxes, such as milliners and dressmakers use in Europe, cumbered the corners; and by some means he had procured for himself the sort of furniture that might have come out of a respectable parlour in the East End of London--a horsehair sofa, arm-chairs of the same. I glimpsed grimy antimacassars scattered over that horrid upholstery, which was awe-inspiring, insomuch that one could not guess what mysterious accident, need, or fancy had collected it there. Its owner had taken off his tunic, and in white trousers and a thin short-sleeved singlet prowled behind the chair-backs nursing his meagre elbows.An exclamation of dismay escaped him when he heard that I had come for a stay; but he could not deny that there were plenty of vacant rooms.&#34;Very well. Can you give me the one I had before?&#34;He emitted a faint moan from behind a pile of cardboard boxes on the table, which might have contained gloves or handkerchiefs or neckties. I wonder what the fellow did keep in them? There was a smell of decaying coral, of oriental dust, of zoological specimens in that den of his. I could only see the top of his head and his unhappy eyes levelled at me over the barrier.&#34;It&#39;s only for a couple of days,&#34; I said, intending to cheer him up.&#34;Perhaps you would like to pay in advance?&#34; he suggested eagerly.&#34;Certainly not!&#34; I burst out directly I could speak. &#34;Never heard of such a thing! This is the most infernal cheek. . . .&#34;He had seized his head in both hands--a gesture of despair which checked my indignation.&#34;Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Don&#39;t fly out like this. I am asking everybody.&#34;&#34;I don&#39;t believe it,&#34; I said bluntly.&#34;Well, I am going to. And if you gentlemen all agreed to pay in advance I could make Hamilton pay up too. He&#39;s always turning up ashore dead broke, and even when he has some money he won&#39;t settle his bills. I don&#39;t know what to do with him. He swears at me and tells me I can&#39;t chuck a white man out into the street here. So if you only would. . . .&#34;I was amazed. Incredulous too. I suspected the fellow of gratuitous impertinence. I told him with marked emphasis that I would see him and Hamilton hanged first, and requested him to conduct me to my room with no more of his nonsense. He produced then a key from somewhere and led the way out of his lair, giving me a vicious sidelong look in passing.&#34;Any one I know staying here?&#34; I asked him before he left my room.He had recovered his usual pained impatient tone, and said that Captain Giles was there, back from a Solo Sea trip. Two other guests were staying also. He paused. And, of course, Hamilton, he added.&#34;Oh, yes! Hamilton,&#34; I said, and the miserable creature took himself off with a final groan.</p><h2>Rising Up and Rising Down</h2><p>A labor of seventeen years, Vollmann&#39;s first book of nonfiction since 1992&#39;s An Afghanistan Picture Show is a gravely urgent invitation to look back at the world&#39;s long, bloody path and find some threads of meaning, wisdom, and guidance to plot a moral course. From the street violence of prostitutes and junkies to the centuries-long battles between the Native Americans and European colonists,Vollmann&#39;s mesmerizing imagery and compelling logic is presented with authority born of astounding research and personal experience.</p><p><p>William T. Vollmann is the author of seven novels, three collections of stories, and a seven-volume critique of violence, <em>Rising Up and Rising Down</em>. He is also the author of <em>Poor People</em>, a worldwide examination of poverty through the eyes of the impoverished themselves; <em>Riding Toward Everywhere</em>, an examination of the train-hopping hobo lifestyle; and Imperial, a panoramic look at one of the poorest areas in America. He has won the PEN Center USA West Award for Fiction, a Shiva Naipaul Memorial Prize and a Whiting Writers' Award. His journalism and fiction have been published in <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>Esquire</em>, <em>Spin</em> and <em>Granta</em>. Vollmann lives in Sacramento, California.</p>This massive, unprecedented book, begun in the early '80s and mostly completed by 1998, is nothing less than "a critique of terrorist, defensive, military and police activity," along with an attempt to construct a moral calculus for the human use of violence. Focused on political violence--or force used to realign the ways in which power is distributed among and within groups and states--the book emerges out of several related questions that Vollmann (The Atlas, etc.) answers with historical and ideological analysis, phenomenological and physical description, reportage and quotation: when do people use violence for political ends, how do they justify it and at what scale do they undertake it given differing situations and ideas about them? Although Vollmann does not deal with the events of September 11 or their aftermath, the book could not be more timely, and, within certain limits, it is almost as successful as it is ambitious. The title refers to the rise and fall of states, empires, and militarized factions and groups. A "part-time journalist of armed politics," Vollmann is neither morbid ("I am not titillated by death") nor sentimental about means and ends. Yet he is also not quite a philosopher, historian (despite his Seven Dreams series of historical novels) or social scientist. The discussions of history and historical figures, which make up a great deal of the project, have a hard time competing with the contemporary interviews and photographs which are almost always gripping and immediate. As fans of his books on San Francisco skinheads, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and global prostitution will recognize, he is at his best when recording impressions of specific, unfamiliar situations and detailing the associations they trigger. His interviews (here including Taliban interior minister Abdul Razzak) are rendered with a dispassion that often matches that of The Executioner's Song. In his quest for the complete set of human motivations for violence, Vollmann travels to an astonishing range of places and sifts a monumental number of texts. The work begins in the Paris catacombs, lined with human remains ("my o's like death's heads, my i's and l's like ribs, my b's q's, p's and d's like ball-ended humeri broken in half"), and ends with an intense reportorial treatment of discrimination against the Buraku people in Japan--with the final volume "extracting" an actual moral calculus from the preceding six. In between, Vollmann tallies places, figures, organizations and writings including Aquinas; an Afghani woman named Anjillah; the Amazon Antiope; an Aryan Nations pamphlet; the group known as Black Organizing Power; the 19th-century U.S. Bureau of Land Management; Cicero; Columbine; the Democratic Republic of Congo; Gandhi; "General X" of the Khmer Rouge; Idrimi, king of the ancient Mideastern city of Alalakh; Lenin; Leonidas, king of Sparta; the northern magnetic pole; Montezuma; Robespierre; Saddam City; Zagreb--and many, many other figures and locales. In its length, this project equals Winston Churchill's somewhat similarly themed History of the English-Speaking Peoples. Conceptually, a better comparison is Burton's The Anatomy of Melancholy, though the present book is about three times as long, and violence has almost certainly directly killed many more people than melancholia. The photos work similarly to those in James Agee and Walker Evans's Let Us Now Praise Famous Men. Proust's treatment of memory in In Search of Lost Time also makes sense as a comparison, but the people and places number far fewer there. Some will object that Vollmann's analyses and syntheses are not sufficiently systematic, but what keeps this book from full-on greatness is that it does not create a style or sensibility that is shocking in and of itself, and that finally holds its unwieldly contents together. Rather, at its best, its rigorous, novelistic, imaginative, sonorous prose treats a fundamental topic on a grand (and horrific) scale. And that is enough, since the book is designed to get ordinary people thinking about the role violence, even at a distance, plays in their lives, and what part even bystanders play in the world's calculus. Given the price of this slipcased edition, however, many will have to reserve it at the library. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Making Intimate Connections: Seven Guidelines for Great Relationships and Better Communication (Rebuilding Books)</h2><p>This is the first book to apply Dr. Ellis's famous &#x201c;Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy&#x201d; principles to intimate relationships.

This is the seventh Seneca Falls Mystery. A previous Seneca Falls Mystery, <b>The Stalking-Horse</b>, was chosen by the Voice of Youth Advocacy as one of 1998&#x2019;s best adult mysteries for young adults and received a &#x201c;best&#x201d; review in <b>Library Journa</b>l&#x2019;s young adult section.Unmarried (by choice) librarian Glynis Tryon (Seneca Falls Inheritance, 1992) learns firsthand of the iniquities of slavery when her boardinghouse landlady's son Niles returns to their western New York home with Kiri--a beautiful mulatto slave he helped escape from a Virginia plantation. A slave-catcher is on their trail, and though Glynis manages to get Kiri to her sister's house in Rochester, a stop on the Underground Railroad, Niles is captured and returned to Virginia to stand trial. In Richmond to help Niles's lawyer, Glynis learns that three recent murders back home all tie in with Kiri--and with the murder of her fleeing family 13 years before by a villainous overseer, now living up north under another identity. With help from Constable Sundown and Cullen Stuart, a Pinkerton detective, Glynis and Kiri bait a trap for the villain and spring it during the debut performance of Macbeth at Seneca Falls's just-opened theater. Stimulating fare (despite a subplot or two too many) that effectively parallels the powerlessness of slaves and women--the disenfranchised--building to a dramatic courtroom sequence. Sojourner Truth, Matthew Brady, et al., appear in memorable cameos. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

That the Beatles were an unprecedented phenomenon is a given. In <i>Can&#x2019;t Buy Me Love</i>, Jonathan Gould seeks to explain why, placing the Fab Four in the broad and tumultuous panorama of their time and place, rooting their story in the social context that girded both their rise and their demise. <br><br>Beginning with their adolescence in Liverpool, Gould describes the seminal influences&#x2013;&#x2013;from Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry to <i>The Goon Show </i>and <i>Alice&#x2019;s Adventures in Wonderland</i>&#x2013;&#x2013;that shaped the Beatles both as individuals and as a group. In addition to chronicling their growth as singers, songwriters, and instrumentalists, he highlights the advances in recording technology that made their sound both possible and unique, as well as the developments in television and radio that lent an explosive force to their popular success. With a musician&#x2019;s ear, Gould sensitively evokes the timeless appeal of the Lennon-McCartney collaboration and their emergence as one of the most creative and significant songwriting teams in history. And he sheds new light on the significance of Sgt. Pepper&#x2019;s Lonely Hearts Club Band as rock&#x2019;s first concept album, down to its memorable cover art.<br><br>Behind the scenes Gould explores the pivotal roles played by manager Brian Epstein and producer George Martin, credits the influence on the Beatles&#x2019; music of contemporaries like Bob Dylan, Brian Wilson, and Ravi Shankar, and traces the gradual escalation of the fractious internal rivalries that led to the group&#x2019;s breakup after their final masterpiece, Abbey Road. Most significantly, by chronicling their revolutionary impact on popular culture during the 1960s, <i>Can&#x2019;t Buy Me Love</i> illuminates the Beatles as a charismatic phenomenon of international proportions, whose anarchic energy and unexpected import was derived from the historic shifts in fortune that transformed the relationship between Britain and America in the decades after World War II. <br><br>From the Beats in America and the Angry Young Men in England to the shadow of the Profumo Affair and JFK&#x2019;s assassination, Gould captures the pulse of a time that made the Beatles possible&#x2014;and even necessary. As seen through the prism of the Beatles and their music, an entire generation&#x2019;s experience comes astonishingly to life. Beautifully written, consistently insightful, and utterly original, <i>Can&#x2019;t Buy Me Love</i> is a landmark work about the Beatles, Britain, and America.</p><p>JONATHAN GOULD is a writer and a former professional musician who studied with the eminent jazz drummer Alan Dawson and spent many years working in bands and recording studios. In addition to writing and playing music, Gould has raised a family, served in local politics, and taken an active role in the life of the upstate New York community where he has lived for the past twenty-five years. He currently divides his time between New York City and Willow, New York.Chapter 1<br><br>Now, you&#x2019;ve got to keep in mind that Elvis Presley was probably, innately, the most introverted person that came into that studio. Because he didn&#x2019;t play with bands. He didn&#x2019;t go to this little club and pick and grin. All he did was sit with his guitar on the side of his bed at home.<br><br>&#x2014;Sam Phillips<br><br>Well since my baby left me . . .&#x201d; The voice, unaccompanied but for the tinny flourish of piano that anchors the end of each line, was somehow bigger and riper with feeling than any voice its young listeners had ever heard. &#x201c;Well I found a new place to dwell . . .&#x201d; It projected an authority and an insolence that reached beyond the words themselves, and it came from a place beyond the realm of &#x201c;entertainment&#x201d; as they had ever conceived of the term. Now joined by a doomstruck bass line, the sound of that voice seemed only to grow larger and more menacing, yet closer and more confiding as well, as if &#x2014;given the lurching slow-dance tempo of the music&#x2014;the singer&#x2019;s lips were pressed tight against the ear of the girl he now began to address, his words expressing a vengeful wish to make her feel the same way he was feeling in his room at the Heartbreak Hotel: &#x201c;So lonely I could die.&#x201d; Though such things had been said for time immemorial in the lives of ordinary people; and though similar expressions of such dire emotion could be found in a growing number of avowedly realistic novels, plays, and films; and though something very much like it had been available for years on the sorts of records that most people never heard (including earlier, more obscure records by this same singer)&#x2014;the fact remained that no man had ever sounded this way, or spoken this way to a woman, in front of so many millions of listeners before.<br><br>Elvis Presley was the catalyst, not the originator, of the phenomenon called rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll. Three years before he made his first recordings, the term was being promoted by a Cleveland disc jockey named Alan Freed as a race-neutral pseudonym for the black rhythm and blues that Freed began beaming across a wide swath of the North American continent in 1951. In 1954, the year that Freed moved his radio show, &#x201c;Moondog&#x2019;s Rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; Roll Party,&#x201d; to New York City, a white band singer named Bill Haley (himself a former disc jockey) recorded a pair of songs on the Decca label, one a novelty tune with a snappy tick-tock rhythm called &#x201c;Rock Around the Clock,&#x201d; the other a sanitized &#x201c;cover&#x201d; version of a current rhythm-and-blues hit by Joe Turner called &#x201c;Shake, Rattle and Roll.&#x201d; &#x201c;Rock Around the Clock&#x201d; failed to catch on at first, but Haley&#x2019;s pallid rendition of &#x201c;Shake, Rattle and Roll&#x201d; became a hit record, rising into the Billboard Top Ten in the fall of 1954. The following year, &#x201c;Rock Around the Clock&#x201d; was featured on the soundtrack of a film called Blackboard Jungle&#x2014;one of a spate of Hollywood movies designed to exploit the rising tide of public anxiety about juvenile delinquency in America. Placed in a suitably inflammatory context, the song caught fire, reaching number one on the pop charts in the summer of 1955, turning the chubby, thirtyish, tartan-jacketed Haley into the world&#x2019;s first rock-&#x2019;n&#x2019;-roll star.<br><br>In the meantime, legend has it, an eighteen-year-old delivery truck driver named Elvis Aron Presley sauntered into the storefront offices of Sam Phillips&#x2019;s Memphis Recording Service in the summer of 1953 to make an acetate of a song called &#x201c;My Happiness&#x201d; as a birthday present for his mom. (That Gladys Presley was born in the spring only burnishes the myth.) Sam Phillips, who operated his studio in conjunction with a small independent record label called Sun, had concerned himself to date with recording such talented Memphis-area bluesmen as Howlin&#x2019; Wolf and B.B. King. Elvis at first made little impression on him. But Elvis made enough of a pest of himself in the months ahead that Phillips eventually called up an aspiring guitarist he knew named Scotty Moore and asked him to work with the boy. In July of 1954, Presley, Moore, and a bassist named Bill Black came in for a recording test. Sam Phillips asked Elvis what he liked to sing. Elvis, it turned out, liked to sing most anything. He sang country songs in a keening tenor reminiscent of Bill Monroe, and pop ballads in a woozy baritone reminiscent of Dean Martin. Phillips started him out on a ballad, &#x201c;I Love You Because.&#x201d; The performance, like that of nearly every ballad Presley would ever record, was cloying and overdrawn. Then, during a break in the session, Elvis began to fool around with a blues song he knew called &#x201c;That&#x2019;s All Right&#x201d;; Moore and Black fell in behind him, and Phillips rolled the tape.<br><br>Of the many astonishing things about Elvis Presley, nothing is more astonishing than the fact that Elvis &#x201c;never did sing anywhere in public&#x201d; (outside of a couple of high school talent shows) before he started making records with Sam Phillips at Sun. For all its romantic associations with dance halls and honkytonks, rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll was born and reared as the child of records and radio. That the prime exponent of this new style of music should be a singer who possessed no prior professional experience was an anomaly; but it was also a telling sign of the way that record-making would change the very nature of music-making in the years ahead. Presley&#x2019;s inexperience was all the more astonishing in light of the opinion held by many of his fans that he would never sound much better on a record than he did on &#x201c;That&#x2019;s All Right.&#x201d; Not only were most of the mannerisms that would define his vocal style present at the creation&#x2014;from the sudden swoops in register to the habit, derived from gospel singing, of starting his lines with a throat-clearing &#x201c;well&#x201d; that gave whatever followed the feeling of a retort; even more impressive was the extent to which his first professional recording was marked by the trait that has characterized every great popular singer: the absolute assertion of his personality over the song. From this it might be concluded that Presley was simply a &#x201c;natural.&#x201d; But the truth, as ever, was more complex than that.<br><br>For one thing, the recording Elvis made with Sam Phillips on that hot summer night in Memphis was made in a manner that would not have been technically possible only a few years before. Up through the end of the 1940s, commercial recording had relied upon a &#x201c;direct to disc&#x201d; process that was essentially a reversal of what happened when a record was played on a phonograph: the sound in the studio was converted first into electrical signals by a microphone and then into mechanical impulses by a stylus, which cut a sinuous groove in the surface of a spinning wax or acetate disc. Though this method offered audio engineers little opportunity to edit or enhance the finished product, it was quite adequate to a philosophy of recording whose main goal was to produce as accurate a record as possible of the performance taking place. An alternative technology, involving the use of magnetized wire, had been around for decades, but it was not until World War II that German engineers (working on behalf of Nazi propagandists) developed an efficient means of recording sound on reels of magnetic tape. After the war, this new technology was quickly refined, and by the early 1950s it had all but replaced the direct-to-disc process.<br><br>Tape recording revolutionized record-making in several ways. On a purely economic level, tape equipment was so affordable, portable, and easy to operate that small storefront recording studios sprang up in cities and towns across the United States. Many of the people who operated these studios had backgrounds in commercial radio, and it wasn&#x2019;t long before they grew restless producing audio keepsakes of weddings and award ceremonies and began to think about trying their hand in the record business&#x2014;drawing, like Sam Phillips, on the talent in their immediate area. A chain reaction occurred: tape spawned the storefront studios, the storefront studios spawned the independent labels, and the independent labels, by specializing in types of music the major labels (for various geographic, demographic, and aesthetic reasons) tended to ignore, spawned a record boom. This boom combined with a comparable trend toward decentralization and diversification in the radio broadcasting industry (caused by the advent of television) to propel the American music business into the Atomic Age.<br><br>Tape technology did more than decentralize the recording industry, however; it also helped to democratize record-making by adding a new kind of informality and flexibility to the recording process itself. The big commercial studios in New York and Los Angeles were owned by large corporations and run on a cost-effective basis that equated time with money. They relied on a professionalized cadre of engineers, arrangers, and sidemen who prided themselves, above all, on their efficiency. By comparison with these record factories, the storefront studios had a lot of free time on their hands&#x2014;time to tinker with their equipment, audition and rehearse prospective talent, and, in the case of Sam Phillips, time to coax a historic performance out of a malleable young singer who had never sung in public before. What came to life in the course of that first Sun session was an entirely new vocal personality, as surprising to its creator as it would be to everyone else. &#x201c;I never sang like [that] in my whole life until I made that record,&#x201d; Presley said later. Awed by the capacity of modern recording technology to enhance the sound of their voices, something similar would happen to a great many other young, unformed singers&#x2014;including the boys who became the Beatles&#x2014;in the years ahead.<br><br>Sun Records released &#x201c;That&#x2019;s All Right&#x201d; as a sing...</p><h2>A Cold-Blooded Business (Kate Shugak Mystery)</h2><p>Alaskan private detective Kate Shugak goes undercover to expose the illicit drug trade along the TransAlaska pipeline, but the case is threatened when her cover is blown. By the author of Dead in the Water.</p><p>Dana Stabenow was born in Anchorage and raised on a 75-foot fish tender in the Gulf of Alaska. She knew there was a warmer, drier job out there somewhere and found it in writing. Her first crime fiction novel, A Cold Day for Murder, won an Edgar award. Her first thriller, Blindfold Game, hit the New York Times bestseller list.Stabenow's hardcover debut marks the fourth outing for Kate Shugak (last seen in Dead in the Water ), a native Aleut who is building a solid reputation as a tough freelance investigator. Although Kate has no love for the oil companies drilling in Alaska, she accepts a commission from Royal Petroleum Co. to find out who is bringing drugs into the Prudhoe Bay work site where there have been several overdoses and one death. Over the objections of RPetCo's security chief, Lou Childress, Kate goes in as an employee, getting a good look at her surroundings as a driver for Toni Hartzler, who gives PR tours to visiting dignitaries. She gains an instant "in" with the locals when she encounters Jerry McIsaac, an old acquaintance who works there as a medic. Kate spots plenty of drugs at her first party but doesn't observe anyone dealing. Of equal interest to her are the Native American artifacts being unearthed by archeologists at a local dig. While Kate is getting caught up in artifacts, she fails to notice that the dealers themselves are playing sleuth, putting her in danger. Throughout, Stabenow makes effective use of the regional setting, culture and Kate's personal heritage to add depth and color to this brisk and thoughtful tale.

Her 12 gorgeous rug patterns bring back memories of summers at the shore. Also included are several stunning quilts from her talented sister Laurie Simpson and the coolest beach bag ever.</p><p>Polly Minick began hooking rugs in the 70's - by hook or crook she was determined to accomplish this feat. Being an avid antique collector, she wanted a couple of rugs to go with her collections. The rugs she saw at antique shows were not always in great condition, so she decided to make her own. She felt no need for lessons or that this would be a serious undertaking - she just wanted to make the rugs and be done with it. What she found along the way was that making those two rugs look like what she envisioned was going to take a little longer than she anticipated. She also found that she was "hooked" on rug hooking.<br> <br> Polly and her husband Tom live in Naples, Florida, with their Airedale Anne and love life along the coast. They have three sons and seven grandchildren they love to keep company with - the grandkids also love their current location of Naples.<br> <br> Since she started making rugs, Polly has garnered praise in articles in: <i>Better Homes and Gardens</i>, <i>Country Home</i>, <i>Coastal Living</i>, <i>Architectural Digest</i>, <i>Colonial Homes</i>, <i>Early American Life</i>, <i>Victoria</i>, <i>Creative Home</i>, <i>American Patchwork and Quilting</i>, <i>Romantic Homes</i>, and <i>Elle Decor</i>. <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>Houston Chronicle</i>, <i>George Towner</i>, <i>The Islander</i>, <i>Naples Daily News</i>, and <i>Ann Arbor News</i> have also written of her accomplishments.<br> <br> Polly is a primitive rug hooker and like other primitive rug hookers, she draws inspiration from what is around her. She is inspired by family, home, country and nature. Her imagery includes stars, flags, hearts and houses. Her patriotic works were inspired when their youngest son Jim received a commission in the United States Marine Corps; he is currently serving our country as a Colonel and recently returned from his second tour in Iraq. Jim's service has also inspired her to work diligently for the Semper Fi Injured Marine Fund, which she says is a "labor of love."<br> <br> The whimsy of Polly's motifs and patterns is understandable given her aim to stick to her goal of making her rugs primitive and naive. She describes many of her drawings as "childlike," placing a strong emphasis on her respect and appreciation for early-American creations.<br> <br> Polly's enthusiasm for the art has led to national acclaim as a creator of primitive-style rugs and a highly touted guest lecturer. She enjoys traveling the country and meeting with others who also love fiber art. She is proud of the increased interest in this fiber art over the years, and she feels a responsibility for its continued growth.</p><h2>Groups at Work: Strategies and Structures for Professional Learning</h2><p>This indispensable resource for developing skillful groups includes more than 78 field-tested strategies for structuring time-efficient, task-focused meetings and work sessions.

Bingham and Jerod Pfeffer <br> Natural Timber Frame Homes is a book about the future of houses-those inspired not by a technology-governed and energy-intensive world, but instead developed organically in response to the places in which we live. Through beautiful photography and informed text, Natural Timber Frame Homes explores the quiet splendor of traditional timber frame homes built with straw bales and plaster or clay-finished walls.<br> Author was instrumental in developing and building. <br> The AIA Habitat for Humanity house, and served as chairperson of the AIA Committee on the Environment. <br></p><p>In the rush to acquire bigger and better homes and to pay off increasingly larger mortgages, many of us have been left feeling dissatisfied. Why is this so? There is compelling evidence that what we really desire is not bigger homes, not more space, but better space. <br> Natural Timber Frame Homes lays the philosophical groundwork for how locally available materials result in more durable and beautiful homes. It asks us to consider the source of our wood, stone, clay, and straw and suggests that this awareness contributes to our perception of character in a finished house. Building naturally also gives us the feedback necessary to be conscientious environmental and economic stewards and allows us to play a meaningful role in the creation of our dwelling. <br> This book puts the theory of natural building into practice by providing the tools to evaluate your area for potential building materials. Photographs and drawings pull the theory together into workable timber frame construction details with floor plans that are adaptable to your specific needs, including your climate and landscape. <br> Beauty and character of traditional timber frame homes are a result of natural materials being crafted by the hands of the builder. By injecting ourselves into the process of home construction, we have the potential to live more connected to the natural world and influence the future of the Earth for the better. <br> Architect Wayne J.

Tilly, author of <i>The Vend�e</i> and many other books, chooses the contention of the masses as his medium in painting this vivid picture of the people's growing ability and willingness to fight injustice, challenge exploitation, and claim their own place in the hierarchy of power. </p><p> Contention is not necessarily disorder. The more we look at contention, says Tilly, the more we discover order created by the rooting of collective action in everyday social life through a continuous process of signaling, negotiation, and struggle. In seventeenth-century France, ordinary people did not know how to demonstrate, rally, or strike, but they had standard procedures for expelling a tax collector, undermining a corrupt official, and shaming moral offenders. By the end of the eighteenth century, French people were experimenting with delegations, public meetings, and popular justice. Through the nineteenth century, with the growth of an industrial proletariat, they developed an extensive repertoire of strikes, demonstrations, and direct attacks on landlords and capitalists, as well as conflicts setting worker against worker. In the twentieth century, scenarios of protest expanded to even larger-scale forms such as mass meetings, electoral campaigns, and broad-based social movements. </p><p> Rather than arguing these developments in the abstract, <i>The Contentious French</i> provides lively descriptions of real events, with pauses to make sense of their patterns. The result is a view of politics with the common struggle for power at its core and the changing structure of power as its envelope. </p><p> <i>The Contentious French</i> is bound to be controversial, and therefore required reading for specialists in European history, social movements, and collective action. Its fresh approach will also appeal to students and general readers. </p></p><p><b>Charles Tilly</b>, formerly University Distinguished Professor at the New School for Social Research, is now Joseph L.

Among their fertile, rolling hills and lush green fields, these farm folk speak about their distinctive cuisine in a language that, in some parts of the United States, has been spoken longer than English. Pennsylfaanisch names grace every recipe in <i>Pennsylvania Dutch Country Cooking</i>, and to help non-Pennsylfaanisch speakers with pronunciation, there's a guide and even a glossary of additional food terms. But what's in a name? It's the cooking that counts in this compendium of more than 100 authentic recipes that are both delicious and healthy. There are recipes for breads, soups and noodles, meats, vegetables, and even a section for special holiday feasts. There are beverages such as Wheatland Harvest Tea, made from spearmint, lemon balm, tarragon, and bergamot leaves; desserts such as Hickory Nut Dumplings, served with stewed peaches; and recipes for rye, buckeye, sourdough, and potato breads, among many others. <p> As if the recipes alone weren't enough, <i>Pennsylvania Dutch Country Cooking</i> is brimming with photographs of the countryside, the gardens, the people, and, of course, the foods of this special place.

This organizational structure results in both limited information and restricted thinking. <i>The Silo Effect</i> asks these basic questions: why do humans working in modern institutions collectively act in ways that sometimes seem stupid? Why do normally clever people fail to see risks and opportunities that later seem blindingly obvious? Why, as psychologist Daniel Kahneman put it, are we sometimes so &#x201c;blind to our own blindness&#x201d;?<br> <br>Gillian Tett, journalist and senior editor for the <i>Financial Times</i>, answers these questions by plumbing her background as an anthropologist and her experience reporting on the financial crisis in 2008. In <i>The Silo Effect</i>, she shares eight different tales of the silo syndrome, spanning Bloomberg&#x2019;s City Hall in New York, the Bank of England in London, Cleveland Clinic hospital in Ohio, UBS bank in Switzerland, Facebook in San Francisco, Sony in Tokyo, the BlueMountain hedge fund, and the Chicago police. Some of these narratives illustrate how foolishly people can behave when they are mastered by silos. Others, however, show how institutions and individuals can master their silos instead. These are stories of failure<i> and</i> success.<br> <br>From ideas about how to organize office spaces and lead teams of people with disparate expertise, Tett lays bare the silo effect and explains how people organize themselves, interact with each other, and imagine the world can take hold of an organization and lead from institutional blindness to 20/20 vision.</p><p>Gillian Tett oversees global coverage of the financial markets for the <i>Financial Times</i>, the world&#x2019;s leading newspaper covering finance and business.

In a brightly lit hall, a Christmas dance was under way. Dozens of young men and women were gyrating to 1950s jive music. The women wore full skirts that swirled around them, the men sharp, close-cut suits.2 On the edge of the crowd, Pierre Bourdieu, a Frenchman in his thirties with an intense, craggy face, stood watching, taking photographs and careful mental notes. In some senses, he was at &#x201c;home&#x201d; in that dancehall: he had grown up in the valley many years earlier, the son of peasants, and spoke Gascon, a local dialect of French that was impossible for Parisians to understand. But in other senses, Bourdieu was an outsider: as a precociously brilliant child, he had left the village two decades earlier on a scholarship, and studied at an elite university in Paris. Then he traveled to Algeria, serving as a soldier in the brutal civil war, before becoming an academic.<br> <br>That gave him an odd insider-outsider status. He knew the dancers&#x2019; world well, but he was no longer merely a creature of this tiny environment. He could imagine a universe beyond B�arn and a different way of arranging a dance. And when he looked around at that hall, with that insider-outsider vision, he could see something to which his own friends were blind. In the center of the hall, there was light and action: the dancers were doing the jive. That was the only thing that the villagers wanted to watch, or would ever remember from that night. Dance halls, after all, are supposed to be all about dancing. But &#x201c;standing at the edge of the dancing area, forming a dark mass, a group of older men look[ed] on in silence,&#x201d; as Bourdieu later wrote. &#x201c;All aged about thirty, they wear berets and unfashionably cut dark suits. As if drawn in by the temptation to join the dance, they move forward, narrowing the space left for the dancers .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but do not dance.&#x201d;3 That part of the hall was not what people were supposed to watch; it was being ignored. But it was nevertheless present, as much as the dancers. &#x201c;There they all are, all the bachelors!&#x201d; Bourdieu observed. The people in that hall had somehow divided themselves and classified each other into two camps. There were dancers and non-dancers.<br> <br>But why had that separation occurred? Bourdieu had received a clue to the answer a few days earlier, when he met up with an old school friend. At one point, the man had produced an ancient prewar photo, depicting their classmates as children. &#x201c;My fellow pupil, by then a low-ranking clerk in the neighbouring town, commented on [the photo], pitilessly intoning &#x2018;un-marriageable!&#x2019; with reference to almost half [the pictures],&#x201d;4 Bourdieu wrote. It was not intended as an insult, but as a description. Numerous men in the village were finding it impossible to find wives, because they had become unattractive&#x2014;at least as culturally defined by local women.<br> <br>This &#x201c;unmarriageable&#x201d; problem reflected radical economic change. Until the early twentieth century, most of the families around B�arn were farmers, and their eldest sons were typically the most powerful and wealthy men, as they inherited the farms according to local tradition. Eldest sons were thus considered catches for local women, particularly compared to the younger sons who often had to leave the land in search of a living. But in postwar France, the pattern had changed: agriculture was declining and the men who could leave the farms were seeking better paid jobs in town. Many young women were moving to the cities in search of work. The older sons, who were tethered by tradition to the farms, were being left behind. On a day-to-day basis, the villagers did not articulate that distinction. But the classification system was constantly being expressed and reinforced in a host of tiny, seemingly mundane, cultural symbols that had come to seem natural. To the villagers in B�arn it seemed obvious that 1950s jive music, full skirts and tight male suits, were a cool, urban phenomenon; if you could dance, that signaled that you were part of the modern world, and therefore marriageable.<br> <br>What really intrigued Bourdieu, though, was not just why this economic change had occurred, but why anyone accepted this classification system and the unspoken cultural norms. This distinction between marriageable and unmarriageable men&#x2014;or people who could or could not jive&#x2014;had not been imposed in any formal manner. Nobody had conducted a public debate on the matter. There were no official rules in 1950s France that banned farmers from doing the jive or stopped them from learning the dance steps, buying a few suits, and just jumping into the ring. But somehow those men were banning themselves: they had voluntarily placed themselves in a social category that indicated they &#x201c;could not dance.&#x201d; And the implications for those men were heartbreaking. &#x201c;I think of an old school friend, whose almost feminine tact and refinement endeared him to me,&#x201d; Bourdieu observed, noting that his friend &#x201c;had chalked on the stable door the birthdates of his mares and the girls&#x2019; names he had given them&#x201d; as a sad protest against his &#x201c;unmarriageable&#x201d; state and lonely life.5<br> <br>So why didn&#x2019;t the men protest against their tragic state? Why not just start dancing? And why didn&#x2019;t the girls realize that they were ignoring half the men? Why, in fact, do any human beings accept the classification systems we inherit from our surroundings? Especially when these social norms and categories are potentially damaging?<br> <br>A POSTWAR DANCE HALL in B�arn lies a long way from Bloomberg&#x2019;s City Hall, in terms of geography and culture. Marriage strategies do not have much in common with banks. But in another sense, French peasants and New York bureaucrats are inextricably linked. What these two worlds share in common&#x2014;along with every society that anthropologists have ever studied&#x2014;is a tendency to use formal and informal classification systems and cultural rules to sort the world into groups and silos. Sometimes we do this in a formal manner, with diagrams and explicit rules. But we often do it amid thousands of tiny, seemingly irrelevant cultural traditions, rules, symbols, and signals that we barely notice because they are so deeply ingrained in our environment and psyche. Indeed, these cultural norms are so woven into the fabric of our daily lives that they make the classification system we use seem so natural and inevitable that we rarely think about it at all.<br> <br>Insofar as anyone can tell, this process of classification is an intrinsic part of being human. It is one of the things that separate us from animals. There is a good reason for that: on a day-to-day basis, we are all surrounded by so much complexity that our brains could not think or interact if we were could not create some order by classifying the world into manageable chunks. The seemingly trivial issue of telephone numbers helps to illustrates this. Back in the 1950s, a psychology professor at Harvard named George Miller studied how short-term memory worked among people who operated telegraph systems and telephones. This research showed that there is a natural limit to how many pieces of data a human brain can remember when it is shown a list of digits or letters.6 Miller believed that this natural limit ranged between five and nine data points, but the average was &#x201c;the magic number seven.&#x201d; Other psychologists subsequently suggested it is nearer to four. Either way, his conclusion also contained a crucial caveat: if the brain learns to &#x201c;chunk&#x201d; data, by sorting it into groups&#x2014;akin to the process of creating a mental filing cabinet&#x2014;more information can be retained. Thus if we visualize numbers as chunks of digits we retain them, but not if they are a single unbroken series of numbers. &#x201c;A man just beginning to learn radiotelegraphic code hears each dit and dah as a separate chunk. [But] soon he is able to organize these sounds into letters and then he can deal with the letters as chunks .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;[then] as words, which are still larger chunks, and [then] he begins to hear whole phrases,&#x201d;7 Miller explained. &#x201c;Recoding is an extremely powerful weapon for increasing the amount of information that we can deal with.&#x201d;<br> <br>This process applies to longer-term memory too. Psychologists have noted that our brains often operate with so-called mnemonics, or mental markers, which enable us to group together our ideas and memories on certain topics to make them easy to remember. This is the neurological equivalent, as it were, of creating files of ideas inside an old-fashioned filing cabinet, with colorful, easy-to-see (and remember) labels on the topic. Sometimes this processing of clustering is conscious. More often it is not, as the psychologist Daniel Kahneman has noted.8 Either way clustering ideas into bundles enables us to create order and arrange our thoughts. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t think or make decisions, let alone create new ideas .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;without using a range of mental models to simplify things,&#x201d; argue Luc de Brabandere and Alan Iny, two management consultants. &#x201c;Nobody can deal with the many complicated aspects of real life without first placing things in such boxes.&#x201d;9<br> <br>This need to classify the world, however, does not just apply to our internal mental processes. Social interaction requires shared classification systems too. This, after all, is what a language is at its core: namely a commonly held agreement between people about what verbal sounds will represent which buckets of ideas. However, societies or social groups have cultural norms too, which shape how people use space, interact with each other, behave, and think. A crucial part of those shared social norms&#x2014;if not the central element of a &#x201c;culture&#x201d;&#x2014;is a commonly held set of ideas about how to classify the world, and impose a sense of order. Just as our brains need to classify the world to enable us to think, societies need to have a shared taxonomy to function. Back in the seventeenth century, the French philosopher Ren� Descartes observed &#x201c;I think, therefore I am&#x201d; (or, to cite what he actually wrote in Latin and French respectively, &#x201c;cogito ergo sum,&#x201d; or &#x201c;je pense, donc je suis&#x201d;).10 But it is equally true to say &#x201c;I classify, therefore I think and am a social being.&#x201d;<br> <br>But while the act of classification is universal, the way we do it is not: different societies use a wide range of classification systems to organize the world. These vary even when dealing with issues that seem to be universal, such as natural phenomena. In theory, the way humans experience colors should be consistent. We all live in the same universe, with the same spectrum of light, and most of us have similar eyeballs (except for individuals prone to color blindness). But in practice, human societies do not classify colors in the same way. For decades Brent Berlin, an anthropologist, worked with Paul Kay, a linguist, to study how languages around the world described the color spectrum.11 They found at least seven different patterns: some groups in Africa seemed to divide the world into merely three color buckets (roughly, red, black, and white), but some Western cultures used five times as many categories. That finding prompted Caroline Eastman and Robin Carter, two cognitive anthropologists (or people who work in a subset of the discipline analyzing culture and the mind), to conclude that while the color spectrum may be a universal, the way we classify it is not. &#x201c;Colors can be represented as a grid showing a variation of wavelengths (hues) and brightness,&#x201d; Eastman and Carter wrote. &#x201c;Each color term represents a region on this grid containing a focal point which is generally agreed to be described by that color term. [But] although there is general agreement on the foci both across cultures and within cultures, there is much less agreement on the boundaries.&#x201d;12<br> <br>The way that other parts of the natural world are classified varies as well. Birds are found almost everywhere around the world. But some cultures consider birds to be an animal, and do not differentiate between birds; others make precise distinctions. The English word &#x201c;seagull,&#x201d; for example, is not a category that translates easily into other languages. Similarly, different animal categories can have different associations in different places. Jared Diamond, for example, has looked at how different cultures around the world define their fauna and flora. (Diamond sometimes defines himself as an &#x201c;environmental anthropologist,&#x201d; which is a another subset of the discipline.) He points out that while the concept of a &#x201c;horse&#x201d; is associated with meat in France, and a &#x201c;cat&#x201d; viewed that way in China, those categories of animals are not classified as &#x201c;edible&#x201d; in a place such as America.13<br> <br>The taxonomy of social relationships varies even more. Sexual reproduction is universal. However, anthropologists and linguists have discovered at least six different systems for &#x201c;mapping&#x201d; kin in different societies around world (in cultural anthropology courses at universities these are known as the &#x201c;Sudanese,&#x201d; &#x201c;Hawaiian,&#x201d; &#x201c;Eskimo,&#x201d; &#x201c;Iroquois,&#x201d; &#x201c;Omaha,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Crow&#x201d; systems). There is even greater variation in how societies organize their space, define jobs, imagine the cosmos, organize economic activities, or track time. In some cultures, &#x201c;cooking&#x201d; is classified as a uniquely female job, performed by women inside the domestic sphere. But in suburban America, when cooking entails a barbecue and meat, it is often classified as a &#x201c;male&#x201d; pursuit. Similarly, in Jewish culture, Saturday is classified as a holy day; however, in Muslim culture it is Friday, while in Christian cultures it is Sunday. In many non-Western societies&#x2014;such as tribes in the Amazon&#x2014;there is no sense of a seven-day week at all, far less a weekend. So too with dance. Numerous societies have rituals for dancing. However, in some societies dancing is classified as a religious activity. In others it is considered profane, or the very opposite of sacred. In some places, men do not dance with women, but in other cultures the whole point of dancing is that men and women should dance together. The only element that is absolutely common to all these diverse situations is that wherever and however people dance, eat, cook, arrange their space or family lives, they tend to assume that their own particular way of behaving is &#x201c;natural,&#x201d; &#x201c;normal,&#x201d; or &#x201c;inevitable&#x201d;&#x2014;and they usually consider that the way that other people dance (and classify the world) is not. This variety illustrates a simple, but crucially important, point: the patterns that we use to organize our lives are often a function of nurture, not nature. That makes them fascinating to analyze. And one person who had a particularly interesting perspective on them was the man who stood watching the dancers&#x2014;and nondancers&#x2014;in the B�arn hall, namely Pierre Bourdieu, one of the fathers of modern anthropology.<br> <br>BOURDIEU NEVER SET OUT to be an anthropologist. He spent the early years of his life assuming that the best way to make sense of the world&#x2014;if not the only way&#x2014;was to study philosophy. It seemed a natural assumption, given that he came of age in postwar France, at a time when...</p><h2>Gunsmithing - Pistols &amp; Revolvers</h2><p>With the guidance of top gunsmith Patrick Sweeney, beginners, as well as serious enthusiasts, are able to diagnose handgun problems?for once they?re the experts, deciding whether to do their own work or leave it up to the professionals.

Using the Malheur Basin in southeastern Oregon as a case study, this intriguing and nuanced book explores the ways people have envisioned boundaries between water and land, the ways they have altered these places, and the often unintended results.<br><br>The Malheur Basin, once home to the largest cattle empires in the world, experienced unintended widespread environmental degradation in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. After establishment in 1908 of Malheur National Wildlife Refuge as a protected breeding ground for migratory birds, and its expansion in the 1930s and 1940s, the area experienced equally extreme intended modifications aimed at restoring riparian habitat. Refuge managers ditched wetlands, channelized rivers, applied Agent Orange and rotenone to waterways, killed beaver, and cut down willows. <i>Where Land and Water Meet</i> examines the reasoning behind and effects of these interventions, gleaning lessons from their successes and failures.<br><br>Although remote and specific, the Malheur Basin has myriad ecological and political connections to much larger places. This detailed look at one tangled history of riparian restoration shows how&#x2015;through appreciation of the complexity of environmental and social influences on land use, and through effective handling of conflict&#x2015;people can learn to practice a style of pragmatic adaptive resource management that avoids rigid adherence to single agendas and fosters improved relationships with the land.</p><p><p>A case study of one of the most important wildlife refuges in America</p>"In the remote wetlands of eastern Oregon&#x2019;s Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, Nancy Langston has found a new western parable.

This award-winning rhyming story of a mouse and a monster has found its way into the hearts and bedtimes of an entire generation of children and will undoubtedly continue to enchant children for years and years to come. No home should be without The Gruffalo! This handy board book format is perfect for younger readers. It features the classic story with a stunning redesigned cover and beautiful finish, making it a must-have for even the smallest Donaldson and Scheffler fans! Also available in board book format and with striking redesigned covers are: The Gruffalo&#39;s Child, Room on the Broom, The Snail and the Whale, The Smartest Giant in Town, Monkey Puzzle, Charlie Cook&#39;s Favourite Book, and A Squash and a Squeeze.</p><p>Julia Donaldson is the outrageously talented, prize-winning author of the world&#39;s best-loved picture books, and was the 2011-2013 UK Children&#39;s Laureate. Her books include Room on the Broom, What the Ladybird Heard, What the Ladybird Heard Next and the modern classic The Gruffalo, which has sold over 13.5 million copies worldwide and has been translated into over seventy languages. Julia also writes fiction as well as poems, plays and songs and her brilliant live children&#39;s shows are always in demand.

In addition to his picture books, Axel is the illustrator of wonderful novelty and gift books for Macmillan, such as the bestselling The Bedtime Bear, The Christmas Bear and Mother Goose&#39;s Nursery Rhymes. He also illustrates the popular Pip and Posy series. Born in Hamburg, Axel now lives with his family in London.The eponymous character introduced by this British team owes a large debt to Maurice Sendak's Where the Wild Things Are. When Mouse meets Fox in the "deep dark wood," he invents a story about the gruffalo, described very much like Sendak's fearsome quartet of wild thingsA"He has terrible tusks, and terrible claws, and terrible teeth in his terrible jaws." The gullible fox runs away when Mouse tells him that the gruffalo's favorite food is roasted fox. "Silly old Fox!" says Mouse, "Doesn't he know?/ There's no such thing as a gruffalo!" Owl and Snake follow suit until, with a turn of the page, Mouse runs into the creature he has imagined. Quick-thinking Mouse then tells the monster, "I'm the scariest creature in this deep dark wood./ Just walk behind me and soon you'll see,/ Everyone for miles is afraid of me." Fox, Owl and Snake appear to be terrified of the tiny mouse, but readers can plainly see the real object of their fears. By story's end, the gruffalo flees, and Mouse enjoys his nut lunch in peace. Despite the derivative plot line, debut author Donaldson manipulates the repetitive language and rhymes to good advantage, supplying her story with plenty of scary-but-not-too-scary moments. Scheffler's gruffalo may seem a goofy hybrid of Max's wild things, but his cartoonlike illustrations build suspense via spot-art previews of the monster's orange eyes, black tongue and purple prickles until the monster's appearance in full.

It was too short to provide a full introduction to such a large body of work; perhaps it was too weighted in favour of the later poetry; at the time it was made some famous poems, or portions of poems were still under an embargo imposed by Auden himself which remained in force until his death. This edition contains an introduction which is an examination of the nature of Auden&#39;s genius and of his position and stature in 20th-century literature.</p><p>This edition presents the original versions of many poems, which Auden revised to conform to his evolving political and literary attitudes later in his career. In this volume, Edward Mendelson has restored the early versions of some thirty poems generally considered to be superior to the later versions, allowing the reader to see the entire range of Auden&#39;s work. Selected and edited by Edward MendelsonW. H. Auden was born in York in 1907, and brought up in Birmingham. He went to Christ Church College, Oxford, where Stephen Spender privately printed a booklet of his poems. After university he lived for a time in Berlin, before returning to England to teach. His first book, Poems, was published by T. S. Eliot at Faber in 1930. Other volumes of poems and plays followed during the 1930s. He went to Spain during the civil war, to Iceland (with Louis MacNeice) and later travelled to China. In 1939 he and Christopher Isherwood left for America, where Auden spent the next fifteen years lecturing, reviewing, writing poetry and opera librettos, and editing anthologies. He became an American citizen in 1946, and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1948. In 1956 he was elected Professor of Poetry at Oxford, and a year later went to live in Kirchstetten in Austria, after spending several summers on Ischia. He died in Vienna in 1973.</p><h2>The Zoot-Suit Riots: The Psychology of Symbolic Annihilation (CMAS Mexican American Monograph)</h2><p><p>Los Angeles, the summer of 1943. For ten days in June, Anglo servicemen and civilians clashed in the streets of the city with young Mexican Americans whose fingertip coats and pegged, draped trousers announced their rebellion. At their height, the riots involved several thousand men and women, fighting with fists, rocks, sticks, and sometimes knives. In the end none were killed, few were seriously injured, and property damage was slight and yet, even today, the zoot-suit riots are remembered and hold emotional and symbolic significance for Mexican Americans and Anglos alike.</p><p>The causes of the rioting were complex, as Maz�n demonstrates in this illuminating analysis of their psychodynamics. Based in part on previously undisclosed FBI and military records, this engrossing study goes beyond sensational headlines and biased memories to provide an understanding of the zoot-suit riots in the context of both Mexican American and Anglo social history.</p></p><p>"In the nascent field of Chicano history psychohistorical studies are not abundant.

G. Wodehouse's comic genius are legion, and their devotion to his masterful command of hilarity borders on obsession. Overlook happily feeds the obsession with four more antic selections from the master. <br> Blandings Castle is a collection of tales concerning Lord Emsworth and the Threepwood clan, while Jeeves in the Offing finds Bertie Wooster in yet another scrape-with the peerless Jeeves out of sight, on vacation! Poor Bertie nearly becomes unstuck! Young Men in Spats is Wodehouse at his most sparkling: stories concerning members of the inimitable Drones Club-they may be small of brain and short on cash but they are always good for ingenious adventures. And in The Luck of the Bodkins, the action spans London, New York, Hollywood, and several transatlantic liners, as three dapper young men find themselves in various Wodehousian predicaments concerning their love lives and finances. <br> Each volume has been reset and printed on Scottish cream-wove, acid-free paper, sewn and bound in cloth. These novels are elegant and essential additions to any Wodehouse fan's library.</p><p><b>P. G. Wodehouse</b> (1881-1975) grew up in England and came to the United States just before World War I, when he married an American. He wrote more than ninety books, and his works, translated into many languages, won him worldwide acclaim.The 11 stories in this collection are classic Wodehouse. This means they are hysterically funny, but his writing style places special demands on a reader. Can a narrator deliver silly names like Cyril (Barmy) Fotheringay Phipps with a straight face? With gusto even? Can the distinct accents of the different British classes be mastered? Regional dialects? Happily, the answer to each of these is yes, due to Jonathan Cecil's masterful narration. More than a reading, Cecil delivers what seems to be a full cast performance all by himself, as he shifts pace, tone, even breath quality, to bring dozens of characters to life. This recording is a rare treat.

Published by the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History, Conversations with Cronkite gives readers a rare glimpse into the life and times of Walter Cronkite in his own words. The book contains selections from interviews between the legendary journalist and an experienced oral historian&#x2014;Cronkite's friend, Dr. Don Carleton.</p><p>With the publication of Conversations with Cronkite, readers have the opportunity to discover the behind-the-scenes stories of his life, edited by Carleton to focus on key events, issues, and themes. More than just oral history transcripts, these are the intimate conversations of two friends, covering virtually every aspect of Cronkite's life and career. Illustrated with photographs and archival treasures from the Cronkite Papers, Conversations with Cronkite gives readers the opportunity to once again hear the voice of "the most trusted man in America."</p><blockquote><p>Walter Cronkite on:</p><p><b>His famous sign off "And that's the way it is"</b></p><p>I didn't clear it with [CBS] in any way. I started using it, and [Richard Salant] said, "This presupposes that everything we said is right, that that's the whole picture of the day's news. I don't really think you ought to be doing that." I think he was correct. But the thing had already caught on. It really was just rolling. So I got to kind of a point of being stubborn about it and said, "Well, I like it." [Salant] said, "Well, it's up to you." He let it go. It has been much criticized by serious television critics . . . because of that argument that . . . it was presumptive that everything we said is correct. Which was wrong. I shouldn't have said that. . . . And particularly when we got into controversial subjects like the Vietnam War. In fact, there's a New Yorker cartoon with a guy coming half out of his chair and shouting at his television, saying, "That's NOT the way it is."</p><p><b>Being a United Press reporter during the Battle of the Bulge in World War II</b></p><p>God, it was cold. We looked like Washington's army at Valley Forge. At one point, the troops I was with entered a town, and we got into a fire fight right away. It was very intense. My driver and I hopped out of our jeep and got in behind a doorway. The Germans were at one end of the main street and . . . it was a pretty good fire fight. I looked up and saw a GI . . . leaning out taking a shot or two. . . . I knew this was a story. I yelled out, "What's your name, soldier?" "Colonel Jones." I said, "Where are you from, what outfit are you with?" He said, "Mr. Cronkite, I'm your driver."</p><p><b>On Fidel Castro</b></p><p>He was fascinated about . . . my war experience. Fascinated about the landings in Normandy. A real war buff. At one point I said, "I've been in a lot of Communist countries, including living two years in Moscow. I have yet to see a Communist country that understood the necessity of maintenance of . . . buildings or anything else." [Castro] threw up his hands and said, "Oh, boy, I know that. It's absolutely terrible." I said, "Well, why is it?" [Castro] said, "First of all, it's inherent in the idea of Communism. People don't own things, so they don't take care of them. That's the answer you capitalists give, but it's true."</p></blockquote></p><p>DON CARLETON is executive director of the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History at the University of Texas at Austin.&#34;We all owe Don Carleton a huge debt of gratitude for publishing this landmark oral history of Walter Cronkite. Here, for the first time, is the beloved CBS News anchorman unplugged, commenting on everything from D-Day to the Vietnam War to the moon landing. A riveting and revelatory book filled with invaluable insights on American journalism.&#34; (Douglas Brinkley, Professor of History, Rice University, and author of The Wilderness Warrior: Theodore Roosevelt and the Crusade for America)</p><h2>I Married a Soldier</h2><p><p>Lydia Spencer Lane's account of her life as a young army bride on the early southwestern frontier is both invaluable history and delightful commentary. As an officer's wife, Lane left her home in Pennsylvania in 1854 to accompany her new husband to his first post in the West--the encampment at Fort Inge, Texas, then in the midst of a yellow-fever epidemic. For the next sixteen years, Lane crossed the Great Plains by wagon seven times, traveled nearly 8,000 miles, raised three children, and became accustomed to tours of duty that required the family to move at least every six months to a different set of military forts, frontier garrisons, and trailside bivouacs across New Mexico and Texas.</p><p>First published in 1893 and unavailable for nearly a decade, Lane's narrative manifests a dry wit that lends humor to events that range from the uncomfortable to the terrifying. Through her eyes we see the close-knit social life of an army post, the western frontier's divided response to the American Civil War (including the Confederate invasion of the Mesilla Valley), and the cultures and peoples of the West. As Darlis Miller makes clear in her Introduction, Lane's courage, her sense of humor, her powers of observation, and her obvious love for the western landscape make her an unforgettable narrator, a valuable historian, and a bold exemplar of strength under pressure.</p></p><p>Through her eyes we see the close-knit social life of an army post, the western frontier&#39;s divided response to the American Civil War, and the cultures and peoples of the West.Darlis A.

Tour.</p><p>Bob Paris became famous as the first openly gay Mr. Universe and grew even more famous when he and Rob Jackson, his lover at the time, published <i>Straight from the Heart,</i> a memoir of their life together. Paris has now gone solo with <i>Gorilla Suit.</i> A cross between a personal memoir and a cultural history of bodybuilding, <i>Gorilla Suit</i> details Paris's desire to radically change his body, what that meant to him as a gay man living in a homophobic culture, and his decision to leave the sport once he discovered how seductive its destructive qualities were. <i>Gorilla Suit</i> is not an emotionally wrought literary memoir, or even a tell-all expos�; rather, it is a well-written, perceptive, and ultimately joyful story of a gay man's discovery of what it means to love his body.Praise for <i>Gorilla Suit</i>: <p> "An apologia for every hard-core bodybuilder who understands that while their pursuit may well destroy their health, it feeds their soul. He's the only writer on bodybuilding who doesn't lie for a living. Bob Paris is the first bodybuilder in history with both biceps <i>and</i> balls." --Sam Fussell, author of <i>Muscle</i>. </p><p> "Bob Paris has guts to stand up for what he believes--an admirable quality." --Frank Zane, three-time Mr. Olympia title holder </p><p> "At once empathetic and scathing, Paris's memoir conveys with equal persuasiveness both why he became a bodybuilder and why he found it impossible to remain one." --<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> </p><p> "The perspective Paris brings to this account of his meteoric rise and eventual disenchantment with the world of bodybuilding is, needless to say, fascinating." --<i>City-Pages</i>, Minneapolis</p></p><h2>Zoo Guide: A Bible-Based Handbook to the Zoo</h2><p>Zoo Guide: A Bible-Based Handbook to the Zoo/Workbook/Activities.

Avedon, the celebrated photographer whose portraits of some of the best-known personalities of our age have graced the pages of <i>Harper's Bazaar</i>, <i>Vogue</i>, and <i>The New Yorker</i> magazines since the early 1950s, was prolific during the '60s. Looked at together, his images from those years create a visual time capsule. This large book is filled with a cacophony of Yippies, Black Panthers, Weathermen, Hare Krishnas, Andy Warhol Factory Superstars, pop artists, rock musicians, astronauts, pacifists, politicians, electroshock therapists, media correspondents, civil rights lawyers, antiwar activists, and more--all shot against his signature white background. Arbus, a novelist and writer for magazines including <i>Rolling Stone</i> and <i>The Nation</i> (and the daughter of photographer Diane Arbus), conducted interviews with many of the subjects. Snippets of those conversations provide an intimate and unforgettable document of the tension, vulnerability, anger, recklessness, hope, and empowerment many people experienced during that era. Brief biographies of the portrait sitters, as well as a chronology that spans the first signs of the war in Vietnam in 1960 to its final conclusion in 1973, provide excellent context for the images. <i>The Sixties</i> is riveting. <i>--A.C.

He recounts a year spent as surgeon for a 3000-man combat command, which fought its way from Lorraine to the Bavarian Alps via newly liberated, typhus-ravaged Dachau. Both as participant and observer, his evocations of battles and the men who fought them and of the endless stream of wounded are extraordinarily vivid. He chronicles achievements, friendships and heroic acts along with terror, pain and the stupidity of bureaucracies of all kinds, treating with contempt comfort-loving chaplains, French collaborators and the arrogance of certain generals. Phibbs's compassion, appreciation of life and sense of humor make palatable the horrors he recreates. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.Personal memoirs of U.S. Army medics are not common, and this one is among the best. These frank and highly anecdotal reminiscences of a cardiologist-surgeon who served with an armored division in the European theater tell relatively little of the history of the Army's Medical Service, but a great deal about the author. The effect is like listening to the war stories of a crusty yet still idealistic uncle whose idealism and anguish shine through his skepticism about the human animal.

After enduring the MG harsh training with the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (considered by some to be a worse experience than the fighting front), Maeger went on to be selected as a front-line driver in Russia. He saw combat at Kharkov and at the legendary battle of Kursk. In 1944 he was transferred out for training as an SS paramedic, but after two months was sent against his will for SS-officer training. Overheard making a defeatist remark, he was sent to the notorious SS penal division Dirlewanger on the Oder front, where he survived the horror of the Halbe pocket. <br><br>On 1 May 1945 he was captured by the Russians near the Elbe.

She was sick of watching the world go by without her. She should be outside, exploring the neighborhood and researching the local wildlife, but she was stuck inside. And it was her own fault.<br> <br> <br> <br>Their first week in San Francisco, Ada had attempted a bungee jump from a eucalyptus tree in the park. It was a jump she could have made with no bungee. The bungee was capable of stretching 50 percent of its length with her attached to it, but the branch was barely high enough to make the line taut. It was a careless mistake.<br> <br>While Ada was brooding, her mom came in.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you think you might come have breakfast with me before I go?&#x201d; her mother asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I guess so. I was hoping we could skip the good-bye part,&#x201d; said Ada.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll only be gone for a few days,&#x201d; said Ada&#x2019;s mom. &#x201c;These artists need a little bit of handholding. They aren&#x2019;t as tough as you are. I&#x2019;ll be back in time for your first day at school.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ada attempted a smile and, on her crutches, followed her mom down the stairs only to be nearly flattened by her brother, Elliott, outside the kitchen. He was wearing an eyepatch and a vest. A stuffed parrot hung lamely from his shoulder. Ada had been reading Treasure Island with Elliott. Now Elliott was determined to find buried treasure. Until then he was dressing the part.<br> <br>&#x201c;Easy there, mate,&#x201d; said Ada&#x2019;s mom. &#x201c;You almost capsized your sister.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yarr!&#x201d; said Elliott. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s &#x2018;Captain&#x2019; to you. Get that straight, lady, or you&#x2019;ll walk the plank!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tone it down, Elliott, or you&#x2019;ll spend the weekend in your room,&#x201d; said Ms. Lace.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry, me lady,&#x201d; said Elliott.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do I have to make you swab the poop deck, Elliott?&#x201d; asked Mr. Lace. He placed a plate of French toast in front of Ada. It had crossed eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks, Pop,&#x201d; said Ada. It was hard to stay grumpy around her dad.<br> <br>&#x201c;This blasted parrot won&#x2019;t sit!&#x201d; said Elliott.<br> <br>&#x201c;You need to secure his tail feathers.&#x201d; Ada wrapped the string around the parrot&#x2019;s tail and feet then tied it. &#x201c;That requires a square knot. What you had was a granny.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Arrgh! There ye be, Ruffles. Good bird,&#x201d; said Elliott.<br> <br> <br> <br>&#x201c;Ada, do you remember that lady we met at the farmer&#x2019;s market? Glenda?&#x201d; asked Ada&#x2019;s mom. &#x201c;Her daughter&#x2019;s about your age. They live over on Polymer Street. You should get together with her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And do what, jump rope?&#x201d; said Ada, looking down at her cast.<br> <br>&#x201c;Very funny,&#x201d; said Ada&#x2019;s mom. &#x201c;How about you have her over?&#x201d;<br> <br>Ada shrugged. She wasn&#x2019;t in the mood to entertain.<br> <br>&#x201c;It would give you a head start on being the new kid,&#x201d; said Ada&#x2019;s mom. She stood, stuffing one last piece of bacon in her mouth. &#x201c;Just think about it. I&#x2019;ll leave the phone number.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Kay,&#x201d; said Ada. Her mom gave her a kiss on the cheek. Ms. Lace hugged her husband and her son and collected her bags.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bon voyage!&#x201d; yelled Elliott. &#x201c;Bring me back some gold!&#x201d;<br> <br>Ada&#x2019;s mom squatted beside Ada&#x2019;s chair. &#x201c;Cheer up, sweet pea.

He loves the culture, the art, and especially the myths. Thanks to his <i>abuela</i>&#x2019;s stories, Charlie possesses an almost encyclopedic knowledge of the monsters and ghouls who have spent the last five hundred years haunting the imaginations of children all across the Iberian Peninsula, as well as Central and South America. And even though his grandmother sometimes hinted that the tales might be more than mere myth, Charlie&#x2019;s always been a pragmatist. Even barely out of diapers, he knew the stories were just make-believe&#x2014;nothing more than intricately woven fables meant to keep little kids from misbehaving.<br> <br>But when Charlie begins to experience freaky bodily manifestations&#x2014;ones all too similar to those described by his grandma in his favorite legend&#x2014;he is suddenly swept up in a world where the mythical beings he&#x2019;s spent his entire life hearing about seem to be walking straight out of the pages of Hispanic folklore and into his life. And even stranger, they seem to know more about him than he knows about himself.<br> <br>Soon, Charlie finds himself in the middle of an ancient battle between <i>La Liga</i>, a secret society of legendary mythological beings sworn to protect the Land of the Living, and <i>La Mano Peluda</i> (a.k.a. the Hairy Hand), a cabal of evil spirits determined to rule mankind. With only the help of his lifelong crush, Violet Rey, and his grandmother&#x2019;s stories to guide him, Charlie must navigate a world where monsters and <i>brujas </i>rule and things he couldn&#x2019;t possibly imagine go bump in the night. That is, if he has any hope of discovering what&#x2019;s happening to him and saving his missing parents (oh, and maybe even the world).<br> <br>No pressure, <i>muchacho</i>.</p><p>Ryan Calejo was born and raised in south Florida. He graduated from the University of Miami with a BA. He&#x2019;s been invited to join both the National Society of Collegiate Scholars and the Golden Key International Honour Society. He teaches swimming to elementary school students, chess to middle school students, and writing to high school students. Having been born into a family of immigrants and growing up in the so-called &#x201c;Capital of Latin America,&#x201d; Ryan knows the importance of diversity in our communities and is passionate about writing books that children of all ethnicities can relate to. His first novel was&nbsp;<i>Charlie Hern�ndez &amp; the League of Shadows</i>."Filled with action with fast-paced chapters, Calejo's novel is sure to draw in readers and introduce them to the magic, beauty, and history of Hispanic myths and legends (many of which are elaborated on further in a glossary for those unfamiliar with the stories). This is a perfect pick for kids who love Rick Riordan's many series, particularly for those eager for mythologies beyond Greek and Roman stories." -- Booklist *STARRED REVIEW*<br><br>"He's not the "chosen one"&#x2014;but the bad guys think he is. Mexican-born, American-raised Charlie Hern�ndez just grew horns. And feathers. It's inconvenient. All of a sudden, all the Hispanic (both Latin American and Iberian) myths he learned from his abuela leave the world of legend and reveal themselves in Miami&#x2014;and everyone, good and bad, seems to be after Charlie. A winner for all kids, but it will be especially beloved by Latinx and Hispanic families who may recognize some of the characters." -- Kirkus, STARRED REVIEW<br><br>This magical adventure brings the Hispanic mythologies . . . to life . . . "the detailed attention to various Hispanic folkloric and mythological traditions is accessible to readers new to the legends as well as old hands, and this multicultural story proves to be a satisfying read for anyone interested in fantasy action." -- BCCB, <i>October 2018</i><br><br>"The story is fast paced and jam-packed with many encounters with mythological creatures loosely based on folklore from around the Spanish-speaking world. The glossary at the end is helpful with a description and country of origin for each mythological being.

Author Jared Kennedy traces through the stories of the Old and New Testament how God keeps his promises in surprising ways better than anyone could have ever thought or imagined! Each story highlights for young children God's story of redemption through Jesus Christ and the unexpected ways that God's grace and mercy are revealed throughout the Bible. Children will hear the good news of God's love for them clearly expressed in ways that will speak to their young hearts. Each story ends with a question that Christian parents and caregivers can use to further reinforce the story. Brightly colored illustrations highlight each story and add fun teaching elements of counting, opposites, patterns, and object recognition to keep even the youngest child's attention on these important Christian teachings about God's love.</p><p><b>What makes your book different from other Bible storybooks?</b> Some Bible storybooks miss the meaning of individual passages because they focus on the big picture. Even more often toddler story books miss unifying biblical themes because they're focused re-telling individual stories. A few Bible storybooks--like the ones by Marty Machowski and Sally Lloyd-Jones--do both well, but they aren't geared toward early readers. That's what makes this book different. Through the faithful re-telling of key stories, toddlers and early preschoolers will hear the good news of God's love for them clearly expressed in ways that will speak to their young hearts.<br><br><b>What led you to want to write a Bible storybook for toddlers and first readers?</b> As I said above, there are a number of excellent gospel-centered resources for young children--great story books and curriculum, but few of them focus on toddlers and first readers. When teaching this age group, I found myself reaching back to resources from the seventies and eighties--storybooks by Ella Lindvall and Ken Taylor. I saw a need, and I wanted to provide a more contemporary resource for ages two to five.<br><br><b>Can children that young really learn the gospel?</b> Yes. Jesus said, "Let the children come to me." He meant kids of every age. You see, children often learn the language of faith before their faith is fully realized. As soon as kids start talking, we can help them learn a beginning vocabulary of faith.<br><br><b>What do you mean by "a beginning vocabulary of faith"?</b> In The Beginner's Gospel Story Bible, kids will learn the name of Jesus as well as the names of other key Bible characters. They'll also learn basic Bible words like sin, promise, Jesus, Savior, pray, and forgive.<br><br><b>What are the special features that will help keep beginning readers engaged?</b> In all 52 stories, one key truth is highlighted in bold letters. Each story also ends with a question that parents and caregivers can use to further reinforce the truth. Brightly colored illustrations highlight each story and add fun teaching elements of counting, opposites, patterns, and object recognition to keep the youngest child's attention.<br><br><b>Does the book have a central theme?</b> Yes. The Beginner's Gospel Story Bible traces God's perfect promises through the stories of the Old and New Testament. Our youngest children will see how our good and all-powerful God always keeps his word (Num. 23:19). The way he fulfills his promises is better than anyone could have imagined!<br><br><b>Why 52 stories? </b>One for every week of the year. In addition to being a helpful resource for family devotions, I wanted this book to be a helpful tool for Sunday School and children's ministry classrooms as well. Since there are 52 stories, you might consider teaching one story per week as part of a one-year Bible curriculum for toddlers and young preschoolers.<br><br><b>When I'm telling stories to young children, what should I do to keep the gospel central?</b> As you read the story, help the children identify with the characters who need God to save and rescue them. Then, as you tell the story, make God the main character. Keep who he is and what he does to rescue and save front and center as you tell it.<br><br><b>What kinds of things did you learn about God's Word or about yourself while you were writing?</b> One Bible truth I didn't know is that the Ark of the Covenant went in the midst of the people (Jos. 6:9) when they marched around Jericho (not out in front as I originally wrote down in a first draft--thank God for good editors!). That fact illustrates a key truth for me. To accomplish what God has called me to as a parent and a Christian, I desperately need God to go with me--in my midst--every day. I pray this book will encourage that kind of desperate faith for you and your family too.<br><b></b>Jared Kennedy, MDiv, ThM, is the husband to Megan and the father of three girls Rachael, Lucy, and Elisabeth.

And a little afraid. This year Santa had asked her to get the reindeer ready to fly on Christmas Eve.&#34; Teeka, an Arctic girl who lives &#34;in the shadow of Santa&#39;s Winterfarm,&#34; knows it will be a struggle to round up the reindeer who&#39;d roamed wild on the tundra since last Christmas. Reindeer training is not easy for the hard-working young girl: &#34;Teeka looked at the tangled reindeer, once so bold and free, and began to cry. &#39;It&#39;s my fault,&#39; she said. &#39;I&#39;ve spent all my time yelling at you, instead of helping. I&#39;m sorry.&#39; And one by one she gave each reindeer a hug.&#34; On December 24, Teeka--who&#39;s finally learned how to be a gentle, effective trainer--brings her antlered team to meet Santa and all the elves who have loaded the sleigh. Teeka is asleep on the last page of the book, as Santa and his well-trained reindeer--Bramble, Heather, Windswept, Lichen, Snowball, Crag, Twilight, and Tundra--fly past her window for a night of magical surprises. (Ages 3 to 8)With over thirty four million books in print, Jan Brett is one of the nation's foremost author illustrators of children's books. Jan lives in a seacoast town in Massachusetts, close to where she grew up. During the summer her family moves to a home in the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts.<p>As a child, Jan Brett decided to be an illustrator and spent many hours reading and drawing. She says, "I remember the special quiet of rainy days when I felt that I could enter the pages of my beautiful picture books. Now I try to recreate that feeling of believing that the imaginary place I'm drawing really exists. The detail in my work helps to convince me, and I hope others as well, that such places might be real."</p><p>As a student at the Boston Museum School, she spent hours in the Museum of Fine Arts. "It was overwhelming to see the room-size landscapes and towering stone sculptures, and then moments later to refocus on delicately embroidered kimonos and ancient porcelain," she says.

In this groundbreaking book, Dr. Jennifer Lang delivers a frank, compassionate, and evidence-based guide to healthy sexual relationships, focusing on the crucial role of consent in sex education.</p><p>A board-certified OB-GYN, Dr. Lang breaks down confusing concepts into factual and clear guidance. She outlines not only what consent looks and sounds like, but the importance of recognizing when a person has the capacity to give consent, and when they don&#x2019;t. Written for all teens, and inclusive of all sexual identities and orientations, <em>Consent</em> is a reference guide to healthy sexual expression and relationships.</p><p>This book&#x2019;s approach to sex education covers:</p><ul><li><strong>An overview of human sexuality</strong> including what sex is and how it feels, separating sex education fact from fiction.</li><li><strong>A discussion about relationships &amp; dating</strong> and the various forms they take during adolescence, including some of the most common scenarios and healthy ways of handling them. </li><li><strong>Tools for communicating and understanding consent</strong>, as well as critical information about the capacity to give consent, the language surrounding it, and what constitutes abuse and assault. </li></ul><p>The way that teens think and talk about sex today has changed. Sex education needs to change, too. Teens and young adults will find the sex education information they need to make empowered choices about their bodies, their desires, and their boundaries in <em>Consent.</em> You&#x2019;ll never think of sex education in the same way again.</p></p><p><p><strong>JENNIFER LANG, MD,</strong> is the cofounder and creator of <em>Buzz llc</em>, a social impact tech start-up working to address the sexual assault epidemic on college campuses. She received her medical education at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, where she received the Dean&#x2019;s Award: &#x201c;Holding Promise for the Future of Medicine.&#x201d; She completed her residency in Obstetrics and Gynecology at St. Luke&#x2019;s/Roosevelt Hospital Center of Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City. She practiced as a board-certified ob-gyn and gynecologic oncologist, specializing in integrative and preventative medicine, and minimally invasive and robotic surgery. In 2013, she cofounded an international medical nonprofit that delivers cervical cancer prevention services to women in resource-poor countries. Since then, the nonprofit has grown to support 80 clinics spanning Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and Central America. She is the author of <em>The Whole 9 Months: A Week-By-Week Pregnancy Guide with Recipes for a Healthy Start</em>, and mother of three intelligent (and slightly precocious) kids, who always ask the hardest questions.</p><p>"Dr. Lang&#x2019;s book should be required reading for teens, delivering important information about sex in a breezy, friendly, straightforward, and highly accessible way. A must-read for anyone wondering about how to navigate the world of consent in the #metoo era."<strong>&#x2015;Amy Ziering, filmmaker and producer of <em>The Invisible War</em> and <em>The Hunting Ground</em></strong></p> <p>"In <em>Consent</em>, Dr. Jennifer Lang covers all the ins and outs of enthusiastic consent and makes the complicated world of sexual relationships quite simple. Along the way, she also makes sex normal and pleasurable, with a focus on conversation and responsibility, creating a space for everyone in the conversation. I love this sex-positive education not only for our teenagers but for every sexually active person!"<strong>&#x2015;Lauren Brim, PhD., sexologist, and author of <em>The New Rules of Sex</em></strong></p> <p>"This vital, accessible book sends the message that young women and men can both articulate boundaries they feel good about, rather than giving in to social pressure or traditional gender expectations. And, it makes clear that consent is key, regardless of each person&#x2019;s gender or sexual orientation."<strong>&#x2015;Lara Stemple, Assistant Dean for Graduate Studies and International Student Programs, and Director of the Health and Human Rights Law Project, UCLA School of Law</strong></p></p><h2>Expect to Win: 10 Proven Strategies for Thriving in the Workplace</h2><p><b><b>Updated in 2017 with a new author&#x2019;s note and chapter on building effective business relationships!</b><br></b><br>&#x201c;Penned by an exceptionally bright woman whose ideas will enlighten you, brighten and brilliantly ignite vision in all who read it.

They hired you because you had the best combination of skills, personality, and potential and a unique blend of values and abilities. Over any other person they interviewed, the company felt that you could best execute the job, fulfill their need for talent, and satisfy their specific need for a discrete skill set. You got the job because you had a competitive advantage over all of the other candidates. That important competitive advantage? <i>You.</i> No one else can be you the way you can; this is your source of power within the organization. </p><p>One of the keys to your long-term success in any organization is to own the person who you <i>really</i> are. If you bring that original, best you to work every day, the one that interviewed for and got the job, then you can maintain your competitive advantage in the orga nization now and, more importantly, over time. </p><p>Bringing the real you to work allows you to be free! Free to learn new concepts, free to be creative and responsive, free to take risks&#x2014;all of which helps to enhance the professional that you are and makes you valuable to the organization. In today&#x2019;s competitive environment, the person who learns new concepts quickly, who can adapt commercially, or, in other words, can apply those lessons in a way that can make money for the firm, and who is also client-oriented, is the person who moves most quickly in a company and is most handsomely rewarded. </p><p>If you are preoccupied with trying to play a role or trying to behave, speak, or act the way you <i>think</i> others want you to, your mind won&#x2019;t be free to perform at your highest level, be flexible, and be able to adapt to changes. Putting on an act eventually becomes exhausting and uses up valuable mental capacity that could instead be directed toward making important contributions at work. </p><p>The reason that I am such a strong advocate for being who you really are at work is that doing so gives you confidence. When you are comfortable with who you are, you exude confidence, and that&#x2019;s attractive to clients and to colleagues. Others want to listen to confident people; they want to hear your ideas, they trust your judgment, and they will buy what you are selling, whether it is a product, a financing pitch, or a decision. </p><p>When you are not being who you really are, at some point you will begin to appear uncomfortable to others. Especially in client- facing businesses, such as investment banking or sales, trust in relationships is an important element of success. When you act and speak with confidence, it contributes to your performance. If you appear to be tentative or apprehensive (which usually happens when you are lacking confidence), then you open the door for your clients to doubt what you are saying, you potentially lose the opportunity to win the business, and you open the door for a competitor to get the upper hand in a relationship. </p><p>A lack of confidence can also hurt in your internal interactions as well. When you are confident with who you are, it helps you to build trust in relationships with the people you work with. Especially if your work environment is very competitive or has a relatively flat hierarchy, which also tends to intensify internal competition, then it is imperative that you have confidence in who you are and what you are doing. If you are in a competitive environment where the rule is &#x201c;up or out&#x201d; (either you move up within the organization over a period of time or you have to leave the organization) and your colleagues realize that you are not comfortable with who you are or in your work, then they will actively try to find ways to make you doubt yourself. </p><p>If you are constantly questioning your abilities in the workplace, then sooner or later your boss is likely to notice and their trust or belief in you will be impaired. And when your boss starts to doubt whether or not you can do the work or have the ability to sell your ideas, then you are very likely to be viewed as someone who cannot or should not move up within the organization or get the opportunity to have bigger or better clients or other responsibilities. </p><p>We all have strengths and weaknesses, gifts and talents. Have the confidence to play up yours. Be proud about what you do well and who you are. And work to improve your weaknesses whenever possible. You don&#x2019;t have to wear either on your sleeve, but don&#x2019;t suppress what&#x2019;s good and interesting about yourself either. </p><p>Putting on an act eventually will manifest itself into appearing discontent, and if it&#x2019;s at a really inopportune moment, such as when you&#x2019;re presenting to an important client, it could cost you a piece of business, a new assignment, or a promotion. And if clients or colleagues feel they don&#x2019;t know who you are, that you will lean any way the wind blows, they won&#x2019;t fully trust you. When that happens, you have created a competitive disadvantage for yourself compared to the colleague who is confident, stands by their word, and knows who they are. </p><p><b>Know Who You Are</b></p><p>So how do you know who you are? It seems like an easy question, but many people have never really taken the time to think about it. If you haven&#x2019;t, you need to ask yourself some important questions: What are your key strengths and weaknesses? Why are you in the profession that you are in? Why did you choose the firm that you chose? What are your goals at the firm, in that department, and for the specific job or seat that you are in? </p><p>You get to know who you are not only by asking these questions, but also by the experiences you have and by paying close attention to how you react in different situations and understanding why you are doing what you are doing. When you are comfortable with the decisions that <i>you</i> make and why you make them, then you are starting to get a handle on who you really are. Further, knowing who you are helps you to quickly identify when things go awry or when your career is veering off track, and it helps you to quickly identify solutions to remedy challenging situations. If you know who you are in an environment, where you belong, and how you fit in, then you will have the confidence to make changes or to speak up as needed to make sure that you are maximizing your success. </p><p>In order to stay focused on remaining authentic and being the best original you can be, you must first understand what your competitive strengths are and concentrate on improving your weaknesses. In any situation, you always want to both lead with your strengths and commit to making time to improve those skills that you think you need to work on. At all times, you must be able to explain why you belong in a particular position, why <i>you</i> deserve a promotion, why you deserve the raise or the highest tier of bonuses, or simply why you are so good at what you do. </p><p>Focusing on these questions will help you develop that all-important &#x201c;elevator speech.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s the quick speech you need to have at the ready at all times; the one that explains to people who you are and what you want in the time it takes to go up or down the elevator. This is an important skill to develop. You never know when or where you will have the opportunity to talk to someone about your strengths and goals within a company. Therefore, you need to be clear about you, your goals, and your assets, and have your elevator speech about yourself ready to use at any time. Your power lies in putting your best self forward every day. If you are always focused on presenting your authentic self wherever you go, you will be able to automatically present a speech about yourself whenever the situation demands it, and you&#x2019;ll be able to do so in a compelling and convincing manner. </p><p>The people who seem comfortable in their own skin and who are bringing their real selves to work generally also are the same people who can have an honest dialogue with their bosses, who have the courage to ask for the promotion, the bonus, or the new assignment, and who are quick to point out when someone or something is impeding their success. On the other hand, those who have submerged who they truly are, or, worse, have completely lost sight of who they are, are the people who typically are passive about their career, generally unhappy, and under the illusion that things will just happen for them without any effort on their part. These people generally don&#x2019;t own their decisions, their positions, their career trajectory (the direction your career will take), or themselves. They are not the first to be thought of for new assignments or promotions. Their careers tend to stall and they are left behind. </p><p>Consider Peter, who outside of the office is a very charismatic guy. He is affable and comfortable with who he is; he loves to debate, and is extremely articulate. He builds relationships easily and loves to connect people in his network. He is also recognized as a &#x201c;brainiac&#x201d; among his peers because of his outstanding analytical and structuring skills. At work, however, Peter is a completely different person. He is quiet and in meetings often only speaks after everyone else has spoken. He never leads a discussion unless pushed by his boss and he has never articulated in a concrete, compelling manner what he wants from the organization or what he wants out of his career. He is afraid of rocking the boat. </p><p>Peter often develops creative financing ideas and shares them with peers, but he never steps up to take credit for or be recognized for his contribution, instead allowing his ideas to be integrated with those of others. Peter has been at his firm for eighteen years and has not had a promotion in more than eight years. Even though he does excellent work, he is not perceived as someone who can penetrate client thought, make and close a sale, or be solely responsible for generating revenue. He is not perceived as a leader; a solid citizen, yes, but not a leader. </p><p>There is a distinct difference between inside-the-office Peter and outside-the-office Peter, and unfortunately that difference is costing Peter in his career. The outside Peter is an influential thought leader. He makes compelling arguments and leads people to his way of thinking. Yet he does not bring that Peter to work with him every day. He is not his authentic self in the work environment, and as a result his career has stalled. If he would exercise his voice, leverage his outstanding structuring skills, and sell them internally, he would move quickly within the organization. He clearly cares about his work, but he hasn&#x2019;t approached his boss and outlined what he wants from his career, from the organization, and how he can get there. Since he has submerged that part of who he is, he is not realizing his full value in the organization professionally or economically. </p><p>Owning who you are really are will give you the confidenceto speak up for yourself if you think you are not being treated fairly or not being properly recognized for who you are and your contributions to the organization. I often find that people who think that the organization is not recognizing their contributions, are in fact not really exhibiting the skills, strengths, or traits that they think they are. Before you start to blame the organization for not seeing what you offer, ask yourself, Am I showing them that I can penetrate or influence client thought? That I can win client business? That I care about being promoted? Or am I assuming that the organization should know this or observe this on its own? Am I bringing my contributions to the table in a visible and compelling way?&#x201d; </p><p><b>Authenticity Transcends the Personality </b></p><p>When I say to bring your authentic self to work, I am not saying that if you like wearing jeans and T-shirts and the code of attire at your workplace is conservative button-down suits that you should come to the office wearing your casual attire. Part of being authentic is choosing a job and an environment that you are comfortable working in, one where you know that you can comply with both the written and unwritten rules. </p><p>Consider the code of attire within financial services. The common code of attire at all of the big brokerage houses is expensive, conservative suits, shoes, scarves, ties, and so on for both men and women. While still largely the same, things have relaxed a bit in recent times with the introduction of casual business attire. When I made the decision that financial services was the industry I wanted to pursue a career in and an environment that I wanted to work in, I asked myself whether I was willing to put on that uniform every day. Did I understand the financial commitment that I would be making to my wardrobe to play in this game? Yes! It was part of the territory, and it was a territory that I wanted to do business in. It was also consistent with who I am. I like nice clothes and in most cases I am more of a conservative dresser than not, so it was easy for me to do. I do not feel like I am getting up every morning and putting on a different Carla, somebody who I am not. I may not dress this way on the weekends or at parties, but I did want to work in an environment where this type of uniform was required every day. </p><p>Every industry has a code of conduct, including attire, a persona for its professionals. There are expectations for how you should behave or what your predominant skill set or perspective should be. For example, a banker is expected to have strong quantitative skills; a trader should be able to spot money-making opportunities quickly, to be nimble and a quick decision maker; a lawyer is expected to have great oratorical skills; and a consultant should have outstanding analytical skills. When considering the right seat for you, you have to ask yourself whether these expectations are credible and easy for you to satisfy. </p><p>The expectations of an industry or position have to be consistent with who you are on a fundamental level. If you think it will be a struggle for you to meet them, then you should seriously consider whether or not that profession, career, or job is the right one for you. In other words, if you are a quiet, introspective thinker with creative skills who hates to make presentations and prefers to work alone, then working as part of a sales team at a pharmaceutical company probably is not the right job for you. Conversely, if you are an analytical thinker who loves to crunch numbers and analyze deals, you probably wouldn&#x2019;t do well working in the creative department of an advertising firm. </p><p>Life is way too short to walk into a job every day feeling like you are not operating at 150 percent and excited about doing a great job. If you are resenting your environment or your job, then your authentic self will get lost in that company, as will your competitive advantage. Further, it&#x2019;s likely that your career trajectory will stall and not move upward, or, worse, will head downward. </p><p>If this is the case for you, if you find yourself unenthusiastic about your job or career, stop and ask yourself what would change things. Figure out what you need to help you to feel good about walking in the front door of your office building every...</p></p><h2>I Love You Because You&#39;re You</h2><p>This book has quickly become a family favorite--and this new format with padded covers and cardstock pages will become an enduring classic of the genre.<br><br>As a poem about a mama fox's unconditional love for her cub, this story describes the many moods of all children--from happy to frightened, bashful to silly, and more--and reassures them of parents' abiding affection and approval.

How did he nudge his memory? He stuck letters, court notes, contracts, and even his checkbook in his trademark top hat. When he took off his hat, it was all there!Gr. 1-3. A far cry from the reverent tone of most children's books on Lincoln, this short, anecdotal biography actually humanizes him. Lincoln is shown as a struggling and somewhat disorganized lawyer who makes his way through goodwill and good sense. The book begins with his purchase of a tall black hat. Later, a group of boys rig up a high wire and knock it off his head, scattering the important papers he kept inside. Courtroom stories include Lincoln proving which man owned a young horse by letting the colt loose to go to its mother and his defense of a slave's right to be granted freedom in Illinois, a free state. Although Brenner includes no source notes, she states that all the stories she relates are true. The humor, lively lines, and soft, shaded colors of Cook's illustrations add to the book's appeal. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i></p><h2>2 Chairs: The Secret That Changes Everything</h2><p>In this world you will have trouble.

All of the telltale signs are there: the sound of joyful music pipes across the promenade; the smells of popcorn and cookies waft through the air; and the colorful attraction posters depict all the wonderful rides and shows created for Guests by the Imagineers. <i>Poster Art of the Disney Parks </i>is a tribute to those posters, which begin telling the story of each attraction even before Guests have entered the queue area. <br> Disney attraction posters have been an important means of communication since Disneyland began displaying them in 1956. Not only are they eye-catching pieces of artwork that adorn the Parks with flair and style, they are also displayed to build excitement and disseminate information about the newest additions to the Disney landscape. When the first attraction posters made their debut at Disneyland, one such piece of art proclaimed that Guests could have a "true-life adventure" on the Jungle Cruise. And in 2012 at Disney California Adventure, a poster announced the grand opening of Cars Land-the newest thrill-filled destination at the Disneyland Resort. Both of those posters are reproduced within this book, along with posters from every decade in between.<br> As evidenced by the evolution of the attraction posters, art styles and design techniques have certainly changed over the years. These characteristics also differ from continent to continent. Posters from Tokyo Disneyland, Disneyland Paris, and Hong Kong Disneyland exhibit the nuances in presentation that give each Park's pantheon of posters its signature look. But while artistic interpretations and color palettes may vary from Park to Park and from year to year, the spirit of Disney storytelling is a constant that ties them all together.<br></p><p><b>DANNY HANDKE</b> makes the magic at Walt Disney Imagineering as an Associate Show Producer for the Tokyo Disney Resort, Disney Cruise Line, and Hong Kong Disneyland portfolios.

Jeff lives with his wife and two sons in Massachusetts, where they own a bookstore, An Unlikely Story.Greg Heffley is back, and with him the trappings that made his first outing, Diary of a Wimpy Kid (2007), such a popular triumph. Once again diarist Greg chronicles a hilarious litany of problems, alternating between home and school, focusing this time&nbsp;on the particular punishments of his reprobate older brother, Rodrick. Whether&nbsp;Greg is suffering on the swim team or trying out for the K&#x2013;12&nbsp; school talent show as Magician&#x2019;s Assistant to a First Grader, his escapades are united by his struggle to avoid embarrassment.&nbsp;As before, he peppers his journal entries with his own cartoons (in look and tone, a sort of hybrid of The Simpsons and the Timbertoes), using them as any 12-year-old would&#x2014;to add insult to injury. But the real and deeper appeal of Greg&#x2019;s story is the unapologetic honesty of his adolescence; he comes across as&nbsp;a real kid, and his story is one that will appeal to all those real kids who feel&nbsp;just like him.

That&#x2019;s because trust is not a verb; it&#x2019;s a noun. But what if the real problem is not that we can&#x2019;t trust other people; it&#x2019;s that we can&#x2019;t trust ourselves?"

They run FASTER than airplanes. They build MIGHTY fortresses. They rescue WILD animals.? But one day, when they're looking for a ship to play pirates in, Lou's friend has an idea: ?Up there! The tree can be our ship!? ?Ummm ...? says Lou. This is something new. Lou has never climbed a tree before, and she's sure she can't do it. So she tries to convince her friends to play a not-up-a-tree game. When that doesn't work, she comes up with reasons for not joining them --- her arm is sore, her cat needs a walk, you shouldn't climb so soon after eating. Finally, she tells herself she doesn't want to climb the tree. But is that true, or is this brave adventurer just too afraid to try?<br><br>This delightful picture book from Ashley Spires, bestselling author of The Most Magnificent Thing, perfectly depicts what children go through when confronted with something difficult. With humor and endearing artwork, Spires sensitively portrays Lou procrastinating, making excuses, imagining alternatives and denying she cares. Ultimately, Lou faces her fear, and although she fails, the effort empowers her, encouraging a growth mindset. All the while, Lou's friends model compassionate friendship by offering to teach her how to climb and then moving the game. This book makes a perfect choice for a character education discussion about courage or resilience, or a life-skills lesson on facing challenges. The story also promotes the joy of imaginative play in the outdoors.</p><p>Ashley Spires grew up in the Pacific Northwest, the supposed stomping grounds of Bigfoot. She is the author and illustrator of a number of books for children, including Small Saul and the Adventures of Binky the Space Cat. She was the recipient of the 2011 Silver Birch Express Award and the 2011 Hackmatack Award for Binky the Space Cat and was shortlisted for a Joe Shuster Comics for Kids Award and an Eisner Award for Binky Under Pressure. Ashley currently lives in British Columbia.<p>Ashley Spires grew up in the Pacific Northwest, the supposed stomping grounds of Bigfoot.

Ashley currently lives in British Columbia.</p>PreS-Gr 1&#x2014;Lou and her friends love daring adventures, but when it comes to climbing trees, Lou sulks because she can't do it. Playing high in the branches of a tree, her companions are slow to notice Lou's plight. Midway through the story, they come down to offer help, but Lou isn't ready to climb the tree yet. After considering a few alternative ways to get into the tree, Lou gives climbing a try&#x2014;and fails. Finally, recognizing her lack of skill, the friends take their game out of the tree and back to the ground. Lou holds no grudges and decides to try climbing another time. Digital illustrations include a set of culturally diverse, cartoonlike characters who are expressive yet somewhat unappealing, often set on a background of stark white space with some shading. The artwork is serviceable, but the book's main value is in the message it imparts&#x2014;that it's better to attempt a challenge than to avoid it, although success is not always guaranteed. Lou goes through a range of emotional states in her struggle to overcome her inability to climb, but she doesn't let her obstacle defeat her. VERDICT This tale about meeting life's challenges and not giving up is a good purchase for medium or larger libraries.&#x2014;Gaye Hinchliff, King County Library System, WA</p><h2>The Mini Bar: 100 Essential Cocktail Recipes; 8 Notebook Set</h2><p><b>An eye-catching collection of 100 recipes for cocktail enthusiasts<br><br></b>From the editors of PUNCH, these eight small notebooks, organized by base ingredient, feature classic and modern drink recipes for essential spirits, liqueurs, and wines: whisky, rum, gin, vodka, tequila, champagne, sherry, and amaro. Each notebook also includes space in the back for jotting down that new cocktail creation.&nbsp;Nested in a sturdy slipcase, this colorful compilation is the ultimate bar cart accessory.</p><p>PUNCH is a James Beard Award-winning online magazine devoted to narrative journalism about wine, spirits, beer, and cocktails.<b>AMARO&nbsp;<br></b><br>The Italian word for bitter, amaro (plural: amari) represents the distinctive category of aromatic, bittersweet herbal liqueurs traditionally sipped as a digestif at the end of a meal. Medieval friars and monks used their study of botany to transform herbs and botanicals into restorative tonics and elixirs that people consumed for medicinal purposes. These tonics eventually graduated from medicinal to recreational and spread throughout Europe&#x2014;hence why the practice of taking an herbal or bittersweet digestif after a meal extends far beyond the Italian border, into countries like Germany, France, Denmark, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. <br><br>Italian amaro is known for its regionally inspired, proprietary recipes passed down through generations; in fact, many renowned brands are still family affairs, like Nonino, Varnelli, Fernet-Branca, Meletti, Luxardo, Lucano, Cappelletti, and Nardini. Amaro is traditionally made by macerating or infusing bittering agents like cinchona bark or gentian root with a blend of herbs, flowers, fruit peels, barks, and spices in a neutral spirit or grape distillate that is then filtered and sweetened with sugar. Many are barrel-aged for continued maturation and bottled at 16% to 40% alcohol by volume. The range of flavors of amaro varies from bright citrus to floral to vegetal to woodsy to bracingly medicinal&#x2014;much of it owing to regional traditions and local flora.<br><br>Although there are only a few classic drinks that call on amaro, it has soared in popularity over the last half-decade, becoming an essential part of the bartender&#x2019;s tool kit. In addition to amari, we&#x2019;ve also included Italian red aperitivo (consumed pre-dinner) bitters, like Campari and Aperol, in this collection. While aperitivo bitters are not technically part of the amaro category, bartenders often employ them in drinks in similar ways. <br><br><b>Americano </b><br><br>Don&#x2019;t let the name fool you: the Americano&#x2019;s heritage is distinctly Italian. Born from the Milano-Torino cocktail (equal parts Campari from Milan and red vermouth from Turin over ice), the Americano is believed by some to have been the favored beverage for American tourists seeking la dolce vita in Italy during Prohibition. Though its heavyweight cousin the negroni may have more currency in today&#x2019;s cocktail world, the easy-drinking Americano isn&#x2019;t far behind.<br><br>1 1/2 ounces Campari<br>1 1/2 ounces sweet vermouth<br>Soda water<br>Orange slice or orange peel, for garnish<br><br>1. Add Campari and sweet vermouth to an ice-filled Collins or rocks glass.<br>2. Top with soda water.<br>3. Garnish with an orange slice or peel.<br><br><b>Negroni</b><br><br>Like all good stories, the one about the negroni&#x2019;s origin involves rakish Italian nobility. Most accounts credit the recipe to one Count negroni, a swashbuckling proto-boho who reportedly spent time as a rodeo cowboy in the United States. Legend has it that back at a bar in Italy in 1919 he asked for something like an Americano, but boozier. Swap gin for soda water and, presto, the negroni.<br><br>Navigating a through line between bitter and sweet, this powerful drink&#x2014;a study in balance&#x2014;has evolved into one of the cornerstones of the classic cocktail revival.<br><br>1 ounce gin<br>1 ounce Campari<br>1 ounce sweet vermouth<br>Orange peel or half-wheel, for garnish<br><br>1. Add all of the ingredients except for the orange peel or half-wheel to a mixing glass.<br><br>2. Add ice and stir until chilled.<br><br>3. If serving on the rocks, strain over ice into a rocks glass. If serving straight up, strain into a chilled coupe or cocktail glass.<br><br>4. Garnish with an orange peel or half-wheel.<br><br><b>Boulevardier</b><br><br>Erskine Gwynne was an individual of epic reputation across Paris in the 1920s. A true man-about-town and boulevardier in the literal sense of the word, Gwynne ran a magazine of the same name for American expats living in Paris. Mention of this literary-influenced cocktail appears in the 1927 book Barflies and Cocktails by Harry MacElhone, who was owner of Harry&#x2019;s New York Bar in Paris. Barflies and Cocktails credits Gwynne as the drink&#x2019;s creator. Depending on its permutation, the boulevardier can be seen as a bittersweet variation of the Manhattan or a whiskey negroni. The true beauty of the boulevardier is its adaptability to bitter and sweet, so depending on the base spirit, you can use an array of amari and vermouth to play to the chosen whiskey&#x2019;s strengths.<br><br>1 1/2 ounces bourbon or rye<br>1 ounce Campari<br>1 ounce sweet vermouth<br>Orange peel, for garnish<br><br>1.

But instead of diving back into the drug game, he&#x2019;s teaching a college class, infusing business principles with his signature ruthless edge he developed in the streets.

The crown always lies heavy on he who commands the streets&#x2015;and Kane and Basil will fight to claim their rule, before power is toppled again, in <i>The Streets Have No King </i>by <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author JaQuavis Coleman.</p></p><p>JAQUAVIS COLEMAN is the prolific writer from Flint, Michigan and is known for his witty street tales that depict the street/urban lifestyle. His clever storytelling ability gives readers a perspective from a young street hustler and the authenticity is evident.

Here's a brand-new board book edition of an Eric Carle picture book that's a favorite with littlest cloud gazers everywhere! Little Cloud likes to stand out from the crowd. When all the other clouds drift up, he goes his own way, changing shapes to become a sheep, an airplane, a shark and a funny clown. It?s all lots of fun, but so is playing with friends. So this time, Little Cloud joins the crowd, gathering with his pals into one giant cloud. And then they rain!<br><br>In <i>Little Cloud</i>, Eric Carle celebrates the possibilities of imagination with textured collages of sky-blue and white in a story that will encourage the youngest child to "read" clouds.<br><br>Eric Carle lives in Northampton and Charlemont, MA.</p><p>Eric Carle is acclaimed and beloved as the creator of brilliantly illustrated and innovatively designed picture books for very young children. His best-known work, <b>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</b>, has eaten its way into the hearts of literally millions of children all over the world and has been translated into more than 25 languages and sold over twelve million copies. Since the <b>Caterpillar</b> was published in 1969, Eric Carle has illustrated more than sixty books, many best sellers, most of which he also wrote.<p>Born in Syracuse, New York, in 1929, Eric Carle moved with his parents to Germany when he was six years old; he was educated there, and graduated from the prestigious art school, the Akademie der bildenden Kunste, in Stuttgart. But his dream was always to return to America, the land of his happiest childhood memories. So, in 1952, with a fine portfolio in hand and forty dollars in his pocket, he arrived in New York. Soon he found a job as a graphic designer in the promotion department of <i>The New York Times</i>. Later, he was the art director of an advertising agency for many years.</p><p>One day, respected educator and author, Bill Martin Jr, called to ask Carle to illustrate a story he had written. Martin's eye had been caught by a striking picture of a red lobster that Carle had created for an advertisement. <b>Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?</b> was the result of their collaboration. It is still a favorite with children everywhere. This was the beginning of Eric Carle's true career. Soon Carle was writing his own stories, too. His first wholly original book was <b>1,2,3 to the Zoo</b>, followed soon afterward by the celebrated classic, <b>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</b>.</p><p>Eric Carle's art is distinctive and instantly recognizable. His art work is created in collage technique, using hand-painted papers, which he cuts and layers to form bright and cheerful images. Many of his books have an added dimension - die-cut pages, twinkling lights as in <b>The Very Lonely Firefly</b>, even the lifelike sound of a cricket's song as in <b>The Very Quiet Cricket</b> - giving them a playful quality: a toy that can be read, a book that can be touched. Children also enjoy working in collage and many send him pictures they have made themselves, inspired by his illustrations. He receives hundreds of letters each week from his young admirers. The secret of Eric Carle's books' appeal lies in his intuitive understanding of and respect for children, who sense in him instinctively someone who shares their most cherished thoughts and emotions.</p><p>The themes of his stories are usually drawn from his extensive knowledge and love of nature - an interest shared by most small children. Besides being beautiful and entertaining, his books always offer the child the opportunity to learn something about the world around them. It is his concern for children, for their feelings and their inquisitiveness, for their creativity and their intellectual growth that, in addition to his beautiful artwork, makes the reading of his books such a stimulating and lasting experience.</p><p>Carle says: "With many of my books I attempt to bridge the gap between the home and school. To me home represents, or should represent; warmth, security, toys, holding hands, being held. School is a strange and new place for a child. Will it be a happy place? There are new people, a teacher, classmates - will they be friendly? I believe the passage from home to school is the second biggest trauma of childhood; the first is, of course, being born. Indeed, in both cases we leave a place of warmth and protection for one that is unknown. The unknown often brings fear with it. In my books I try to counteract this fear, to replace it with a positive message. I believe that children are naturally creative and eager to learn. I want to show them that learning is really both fascinating and fun."</p><p></p><p>copyright � 2000 by Penguin Group (USA) Books for Young Readers. All rights reserved.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>A minor addition to Carle's lengthy list of child-captivating titles, this lean tale introduces a cloud that changes itself into a handful of shapes. Calling upon memories of objects it has seen, Little Cloud becomes a plane, a shark, trees, a rabbit and a clown before rejoining its peers. At this point they do what clouds are apt to do when they get together: "Then all the clouds changed into one big cloud and rained!" Popping out from a textured background of rich turquoise, Carle's luminous collage art features broad, swirling strokes reminiscent of fingerpainting. As minimalist as the text, these images may well inspire kids to cast more creative glances at the sky. Although the conceit is imaginative, the execution lacks the inventiveness and extra sparkle of such Carle classics as the "Very" quartet.

A diverse group of toddlers and adults are counting their way to bed in different rooms of the house. Each spread introduces a number as a child bids familiar objects good night. For example, for the number three, the text states, "Goodnight three wheels./Goodnight, three cans./Goodnight, all trucks/and pots and pans." The watercolor and digital illustrations elevate this title above most concept books by providing multiple examples of the number in question. For instance, for the number six, there are six snaps on the child's pajamas, six dots on the lampshade, and six blocks. Detail-oriented readers will love poring over these small nuances and counting everything on the various pages. VERDICT A winner for bedtimes or storytimes focusing on counting.

During his off hours as a dancer, he read some 200 books on the market and the great speculators, spending as much as eight hours a day studying.Darvas invested his money into a couple of stocks that had been hitting their 52-week high. He was utterly surprised that the stocks continued to rise and subsequently sold them to make a large profit. His main source of stock selection was Barron&#39;s Magazine.

Born in 1898, he was educated in Ireland and England. In the preface of this title, Dr Joseph Murphy asserts that life events are actually the result of the workings of your conscious and subconscious minds. &nbsp;He suggests practical techniques through which one can change one's destiny, principally by focusing and redirecting this miraculous energy. Years of research studying the world's major religions convinced him that some great Power lay behind all spiritual life and that this power is within each of us. Dr. Murphy was Minister-Director of the Church of Divine Science in Los Angeles for 28 years, where his lectures were attended by 1300 to 1500 people every Sunday. His daily radio program during period was immensely popular. Murphy was influenced by Ernest Holmes and Emmet Fox, both well-known writers on New Thought principles, but his academic background was in Eastern religion. He spent many years in India and was an Andhra Research Fellow at the University of India. Dr Murphy spent a good part of his life studying Eastern religions, and was a scholar of the I-Ching, the Chinese book of divination whose origins are lost in history. He remains a beacon of enlightenment and inspiration for legions of loyal followers. The Power of Your Subconscious Mind has been a bestseller since its first publication in 1963, selling many millions of copies since its original publication.</p></p><p></p><h2>Don&#39;t Squeal Unless It&#39;s a Big Deal: A Tale of Tattletales</h2><p>Mrs. McNeal turns her class of nineteen tattletales into respectful classmates who know how to behave in a true emergency.</p><p>Kindergarten-Grade 2&#x2014;The piggies in Mrs. McNeal's class learn the difference between tattling and informing an adult in an emergency. After enduring a morning of students "squealing" on one another, the teacher explains that kids should try to work out their kid-sized problems themselves, but they should seek help when a more serious situation arises. When Mrs. M. falls down, the children take the appropriate action and call for help. Although the plot is contrived and the ending abrupt, readers will recognize the familiar-sounding accusations. The brightly colored cartoons are on target and add a touch of humor to the didactic text. A concluding note discusses common reasons why children tattle as well as ways to turn these episodes into teachable moments by using problem-solving skills. This book may be helpful for teachers and parents who need to deal with this particular nuisance.&#x2014;<i>Martha Simpson, Stratford Library Association, CT</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She&nbsp;lives in California.<p><b>Prologue</b></p><p>She should have been dead. After everything he had put her through, she should have died hours before. There had been many moments during the ordeal when she wished she would die, when she wished he would just end the unimaginable suffering he was inflicting on her.</p><p>He had done things to her she could never have imagined, would never have wanted to know one human being could be capable of doing to another. He had abused her physically, sexually, and psychologically. He had abducted her, beaten her, tortured her, raped her. Hour after hour after hour.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t really know how much time had passed. Hours? Days? A week? The concept of time had ceased to have any meaning.</p><p>She had tried to resist physically, but she had learned resistance was rewarded only with pain. The pain had surpassed anything in her most terrible nightmares. It had surpassed adjectives and gone into a realm of blinding white light and high-�pitched sound. Eventually, she had ceased to fight and had found that in seemingly giving up her life, she was able to keep her life.</p><p>Where there is life, there is hope.</p><p>She couldn&#x2019;t remember where she had heard that. Somewhere, long ago. Childhood.</p><p>At one point during the attack she had called for her mother, for her father. She had been overwhelmed with the kind of pure fear and helplessness that stripped away maturity and logic and self-�control, reducing her to a screaming mass of raw emotion. Now she couldn&#x2019;t remember ever being a child. She couldn&#x2019;t remember having parents. She could remember only the sharp pain of a knife carving into her flesh, the explosion of pain as a hammer struck her.</p><p>She had tried to resist the overwhelming desire to break down mentally, to give herself over and drown in the depths of hopelessness. It would have been so much easier to just let go. But he hadn&#x2019;t killed her. Yet. And she wouldn&#x2019;t do the job for him. She continued to choose life.</p><p>Where there is life, there is hope.</p><p>The words floated through her fractured mind like a ribbon of smoke as she lay on the floor of the van.</p><p>Her tormentor was driving. She lay directly behind his seat. He was happily singing along with the radio, as if he didn&#x2019;t have a care in the world, as if there wasn&#x2019;t a beaten, bloody, half-�dead woman in the back of his van.</p><p>She was more alive than he knew. In giving up fighting, she had reserved strength. In giving up fighting, she had stopped him short of rendering her completely incapacitated. She could still move, though there was something wrong with her coordination and every effort set off nauseating explosions of pain. Her head was pounding. It felt like her brain might burst out of her skull&#x2014;�or maybe it already had.</p><p>She faded in and out of consciousness, but she could still form thoughts. Many were incomplete or incoherent, but then she would muster as much will and focus as she could, and something would make sense for a second or two.</p><p>The cold floor beneath her was numbing some of the pain that racked her body. The blanket he had thrown over her to hide her offered a cocoon, a place to be invisible. Her wrists were only loosely bound together in front of her with a long, wide red ribbon. He had positioned her with her elbows bent, her hands tucked beneath her chin as if in prayer.</p><p>Prayer. She had prayed and prayed and prayed, but no one had come to save her.</p><p>He had all the power, all the control. He had killed before, many times, and gotten away with it. He believed he was invincible. He believed he was a genius. He believed he was an artist.</p><p>He said she was to be his masterpiece.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t know what that meant. She didn&#x2019;t want to find out.</p><p>The van hit a pothole in the road, jarring and rocking. She wanted to brace herself, to lessen the movement of her broken body, but the ribbon tied around her wrists prevented her. She strained against it for a few seconds, then stopped trying. The effort made her nauseous. As she rode the wave of the nausea, nonsensical words and images tumbled through her battered brain like the colored glass pieces in a kaleidoscope. As her consciousness dimmed, the glass shards of thought settled in a heap in her mind. The seductive voice of death whispered to her. She could just let go. She could go before she found out what he had in store. It would be so much easier.</p><p>The tension started to seep out of her body. Her hands relaxed . . . and she felt the satin ribbon loosen around her wrists. . . . She put her concentration to the task of working a hand free.</p><p>Where there is life, there is hope. Where there is life, there is hope . . .</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re gonna be a star, Dana,&#x201d; he called back to her. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what you always wanted, right? Network news. Your face on televisions all across America? You&#x2019;ll have that now, thanks to me. It won&#x2019;t be the way you imagined it, but you&#x2019;re gonna be famous.&#x201d;</p><p>He cursed as the van hit another deep pothole. Dana&#x2019;s body bounced painfully on the van&#x2019;s floor. The pain rolled through her like a violent wave. She turned to her left side, curling into the fetal position, and tried not to cry out, not to make a sound, not to call attention to herself.</p><p>Next to her, the collection of tools he had brought along bounced and rattled in their open tote. Not considering her any threat to him at all in her semiconscious, beaten, broken state, he hadn&#x2019;t bothered to put the tote out of reach. His ego allowed him to disregard her. She was little more than an inanimate object to him now. Her purpose was as a prop to prove his point: that he was smarter than any of the many law enforcement officers who were looking for him.</p><p>They had offended him, crediting him with a murder that was sloppy; a careless crime, supposedly his ninth victim. He would show them his true ninth victim. He would present her to them as a work of art, tied up with a bright red ribbon.</p><p>He was a serial killer. The police and the media called him Doc Holiday. These were facts Dana had known before he had abducted her. She didn&#x2019;t fully grasp any of the details now. The story had been boiled down to this: He was a predator and she was prey. And if she couldn&#x2019;t pull herself together and make one valiant effort, she would soon be dead.</p><p>She had to do something.</p><p>She had to summon as much will and life as she had left. She had to form a coherent thought and be able to hang on to it for just a moment. She had to fight through the pain to find the physical strength to execute that thought.</p><p>It all seemed so hard. But she wanted to live. The fire of life had burned down to an ember inside her, but she wouldn&#x2019;t let it go out without a fight.</p><p>Her brain ached at the effort to form and hold the thought.</p><p>Her body protested and resisted the signals to move.</p><p>Under the blanket, her right hand trembled uncontrollably as she reached toward the tote.</p><p>In the front seat, he was still talking out loud. He was a genius. He was an artist. She would be his masterpiece. The media wanted to credit him with a victim who looked like a zombie? He would give them a zombie.</p><p>Dana pulled her legs up toward her chest and shifted her weight, turning onto her knees.</p><p>Where there is life, there is hope.</p><p>Her head swam; her thoughts tumbled. She had to fight so hard to stay in the moment.</p><p>She would have only one chance.</p><p>He laughed at his own joke. He glanced in the rearview mirror as if to see if she had heard him.</p><p>His smile died as his eyes met the eyes of his zombie.</p><p>With all the strength she had left in her body, Dana swung her arm and buried the screwdriver to the hilt in his temple.</p><p>Then everything went black, and she was falling and falling and falling into a darkness that swallowed her whole.</p><br><p><b>1</b></p><p>January</p><p><i>Hennepin County Medical Center<br><br>Minneapolis, Minnesota<br>&nbsp;</i></p><p>She woke screaming. Screaming and screaming and screaming. Loud, long, terrible screams that tore up her throat from the depths of her soul.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t know why she was screaming. There was no emotion attached to it, not pain, not fear. She seemed completely detached from the noise coming out of her.</p><p>She had no awareness of her body. It was as if the essence of her being had taken up residence inside an empty shell. She couldn&#x2019;t feel. She couldn&#x2019;t move. She couldn&#x2019;t see. She didn&#x2019;t know if her eyes were open or closed or gone.</p><p>She could hear the commotion of people rushing around her. She didn&#x2019;t know who they were. She didn&#x2019;t know where she was or why she was there. The people were shouting. She couldn&#x2019;t really understand what they were saying. Only one frantic voice penetrated as it shouted: Dana! Dana! Dana!</p><p>The word meant nothing to her. It was just a sound.</p><p>Like the screams coming from her own throat, these words were just sounds. She continued to scream and scream and scream.</p><p>Then a sinuous sensation of warmth spread through her, and the screaming stopped, and she ceased to be aware of anything at all.</p><p>&#x201c;I know this was upsetting for you, Mommy.&#x201d;</p><p>Lynda Mercer was still shaken and shocked by the sound of her daughter&#x2019;s screams, screams that had come from Dana&#x2019;s unconscious body lying perfectly still on the bed.</p><p>Dr. Rutten motioned for her to take one of the two seats in front of his desk. He took the other, choosing not to put a professional distance between them.</p><p>In his midfifties, Rutten was Dutch, fit, and bald, with large, kind, liquid brown eyes. It was his habit to be close when he spoke to the anxious parents and spouses of patients, to reach out and touch with a large, reassuring hand. While the tactic could have seemed a phony, contrived intimacy, his kindness was genuine and very much appreciated. He was a rock for his patients and their families. He took her hand and gave it a squeeze.</p><p>&#x201c;After all the years I&#x2019;ve spent studying the human brain, and with all the technology we&#x2019;ve developed to help us in our study of the human brain, the one thing I can tell you with certainty is that there is no certainty with a brain injury,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;We can define the specific type of injury Dana has sustained. Based on our experience, we can attempt to predict some of the effects the injury might produce, some of the changes we might see in her personality, in her memory, in possible physical impairments. But there are no hard-�and-�fast rules about how her brain will react to the trauma.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She was screaming and screaming,&#x201d; Lynda murmured, her trembling voice barely more than a whisper. &#x201c;Was she in pain? Was she having a nightmare? All the machines were going crazy.&#x201d;</p><p>She could still hear her daughter&#x2019;s screams. She could still hear the shrill beeping and shrieking of the alarms on the monitors. Dana&#x2019;s heart rate had gone from a normal rhythm to a pounding pace. They had recently taken her off the ventilator, and she gulped air like a fish out of water.</p><p>&#x201c;The screaming is extremely disconcerting to hear, but not an uncommon occurrence for people with brain injuries at this stage of their recovery as they begin to climb their way out of their unconscious state,&#x201d; Rutten assured her. &#x201c;Sometimes they moan or cry hysterically. Sometimes they scream.</p><p>&#x201c;Why does this happen? We believe this is caused by a misfiring of signals within the midbrain as it tries to cope and reroute itself. Neurons are firing, but the impulses are landing in strange places. Also, there can be heightened fight-�or-�flight responses caused by external or internal stressors, resulting in panic or combativeness.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;People scream when they&#x2019;re in pain,&#x201d; Lynda murmured.</p><p>Regardless of the neurologist&#x2019;s explanation, she couldn&#x2019;t escape the idea that her daughter was locked in a deep, unending nightmare, reliving the things a monster had done to her. Not just the skull fracture that had led to brain surgery to remove bone fragments, but also facial fractures, broken fingers, broken ribs, a fractured kneecap. Contusions and abrasions colored her body and her face. The killer the press called Doc Holiday had literally carved into her flesh with a knife.</p><p>Imagined scenes from the nightmare flashed through Lynda&#x2019;s mind like clips from a horror movie. Ligature marks burned into Dana&#x2019;s wrists and ankles indicated she had been tied down. She had been tortured. She had been raped.</p><p>&#x201c;We immediately upped the amount of pain medication Dana is receiving,&#x201d; Rutten said. &#x201c;Just in case some of that was the result of pain, but that may not be the case at all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I shouldn&#x2019;t have left her,&#x201d; Lynda whispered, a wave of mother&#x2019;s guilt washing over her.</p><p>She had left Dana&#x2019;s room for just a moment, needing to stretch her legs. Just a walk to the end of the hall, to the family lounge to get a cup of coffee. As she walked back, the first scream split the air and pierced her heart.</p><p>She had dropped the coffee and run to the room, flinging herself into the melee of scurrying hospital staff. She had shouted her daughter&#x2019;s name over and over&#x2014;�Dana! Dana! Dana!&#x2014;�until someone had taken hold of her shoulders from behind and pulled her out of the way.</p><p>Dr. Rutten squeezed her hand again, pulling her out of the memory to focus once more on him. The corners of his mouth curved subtly in the gentlest smile of understanding and commiseration.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a father myself. I have two daughters. I know how it tears at a parent&#x2019;s heart to think their child is suffering.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She suffered so much already,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;All the things that animal did to her . . .&#x201d;</p><p>Dr. Rutten frowned. &#x201c;If it gives you any comfort, she probably won&#x2019;t have any memory of what happened to her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hope not,&#x201d; Lynda said. If there were a God, Dana would remember nothing of her ordeal. But then, if there were a God, none of this should have happened at all.</p><p>&#x201c;Will it happen again?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;The screaming?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It might. Or it might not. She could drift in and out like this for a long time, or she may become fully conscious tomorrow. She has been saying words these last few days. She&#x2019;s been responsive to vocal commands. These are positive signs, but every brain is different.</p><p>&#x201c;The kinds of injuries Dana sustained can mean she may have difficulty organizing her thoughts or performing routine tasks. She may become impulsive, have trouble controlling her emotions or empathizing with other people. She may have difficulty speaking, or she may speak perfectly but not always be able to grab the right words from her brain.</p><p>&#x201c;Damage to the temporal lobe of the brain may affect her memory, but how much? I can&#x2019;t tell you. She may have no memory of what happened to her. She may have no memory of the last ten years. She may not recognize her friends. She may not recognize herself. You may not recognize her,&#x201d; he said, unable to hide his sadness at a truth he had seen again and again.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s my daughter,&#x201d; Lynda said, offended. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s my child. Of course I&#x2019;ll recognize her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Physically, yes, but she will never be exactly the girl you&#x2019;ve known all her life,&#x201d; he said gently. &#x201c;One thing I know is true in every case: The person you love will be changed from this, and that will be the hardest thing of all to accept.</p><p>&#x201c;In a way, the daughter you had is gone. Even though she may look the same, she will behave d...</p></p><h2>Overcoming Oppositional Defiant Disorder: A Two-Part Treatment Plan to Help Parents and Kids Work Together</h2><p><p><strong>Help Your ODD Child While Helping Yourself</strong></p><p>Parenting a child with Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is difficult, stressful, and often overwhelming. <em>Overcoming Oppositional Defiant Disorder</em> is the first child psychology book that sets you up for success by recognizing that taking care of your child starts with taking care of yourself.</p><p>Using a two-pronged approach, Dr. Gina Atencio-Maclean offers proven methods for modifying your child&#x2019;s defiant behaviors while giving you the tools needed to stay calm and focused&#x2015;even during your child&#x2019;s worst outbursts.

This book is great because it is transparent and easy to follow, with creative exercises that help you relate to real-life situations by bringing you back to the basics. Dr. Atencio-MacLean does a fabulous job describing what is going on with your child. and she provides the most effective strengths-based strategies to utilize in your journey toward collaborative healing.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Candice Waltrip, PsyD, Licensed Clinical and Forensic Psychologist</strong></p> <p>&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t stop reading <em>Overcoming Oppositional Defiant Disorder</em>, and as a psychologist myself, it gave me strength and inspiration.

A book on oppositional defiant disorder that adequately addresses an overlooked but extremely critical component of treatment: parental emotional regulation.

Then I slam my boot down on my electric skateboard. The board is old and used, like everything else I own, its blue paint almost entirely scraped off to reveal cheap silver plastic underneath&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s not dead yet, and when I push my heel down harder, it finally responds, jerking me forward as I squeeze between two rows of cars. My bright, rainbow-dyed hair whips across my face.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; a driver yells as I maneuver past his car. I glance over my shoulder to see him waving a fist at me through his open window. &#x201c;You almost clipped me!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I just turn back around and ignore him. Usually, I&#x2019;m a nicer person than this&#x2014;or, at least, I would have shouted an apology back. But this morning, I&#x2019;d woken up to a yellow paper taped to the door of my apartment, its words printed in the largest font you can imagine.<br> &nbsp;<br> 72 HOURS TO PAY OR VACATE<br> &nbsp;<br> Translation: I&#x2019;m almost three months behind on my rent. So, unless I can get my hands on $3,450, I&#x2019;ll be homeless and in the streets by the end of the week.<br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;d put a damper on anyone&#x2019;s day.<br> &nbsp;<br> My cheeks sting from the wind. The sky beyond the cut of skyscrapers is gray, turning grayer, and in a few hours this flurry of snow will become a steady fall. Cars jam the streets, a nonstop trail of brake lights and honking from here all the way to Times Square. The occasional scream of a traffic controller&#x2019;s whistle cuts above the chaos. The air is thick with the smell of exhaust, and steam billows from an open vent nearby. People swarm up and down the sidewalks. Students coming home from school are easy to spot, their backpacks and fat headphones dotting the crowds.<br> &nbsp;<br> Technically, I should be one of them. This should have been my first year of college. But I started skipping classes after Dad died and dropped out entirely several years ago. (Okay, fine&#x2014;technically, I was expelled. But I swear I would&#x2019;ve quit anyway. More on that later.)<br> &nbsp;<br> I look down at my phone again, my mind returning to the hunt. Two days ago, I had gotten the following text message:<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>New York Police Department ALERT!</i><br><i> Arrest warrant out for Martin Hamer.</i><br><i> Payment $5,000.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> The police are so busy these days with the increasing crime in the streets that they don&#x2019;t have time to hunt for petty criminals on their own&#x2014;petty criminals like Martin Hamer, who&#x2019;s wanted for gambling on Warcross, stealing money, and allegedly selling drugs to fund his bets. So, about once a week, the cops send out a message like this, a promise to pay anyone who can catch the criminal in question.<br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;s where I come in. I&#x2019;m a bounty hunter, one of many in Manhattan, and I&#x2019;m fighting to capture Martin Hamer before another hunter can.<br> &nbsp;<br> Anyone who&#x2019;s ever fallen on hard times will understand the nearly constant stream of numbers that run through my mind. A month&#x2019;s rent in the worst apartment in New York: $1,150. A month&#x2019;s food: $180. Electricity and internet: $150. Boxes of macaroni, ramen, and Spam left in my pantry: 4. And so on. On top of that, I owe $3,450 in unpaid rent, and $6,000 in credit card debt.<br> &nbsp;<br> The number of dollars left in my bank account: $13.<br> &nbsp;<br> Not the normal things a girl my age worries about. I should be freaking out over exams. Turning in papers. Waking up on time.<br> &nbsp;<br> But I haven&#x2019;t exactly had a normal adolescence.<br> &nbsp;<br> Five thousand dollars is easily the largest bounty in months. For me, it might as well be all the money in the world. So, for the last two days, I&#x2019;ve done nothing but track this guy. I&#x2019;ve lost four bounties in a row this month. If I lose this one, too, I&#x2019;m going to be in real trouble.<br> &nbsp;<br> Tourists always clogging up the streets, I think as a detour forces me down a path right into Times Square, where I get stuck behind a cluster of auto-taxis jammed at a pedestrian walkway. I lean back on my board, pull myself to a halt, and start inching backward. As I go, I glance down at my phone again.<br> &nbsp;<br> A couple of months ago, I&#x2019;d succeeded in hacking into the main directory of Warcross players in New York and synced it all up to my phone&#x2019;s maps. It&#x2019;s not hard, not if you remember that everyone in the world is connected in some way to everyone else. It&#x2019;s just time-consuming. You worm your way into one account, then branch out to their friends, then their friends, and eventually, you&#x2019;re able to track the location of any player in New York City. Now I&#x2019;ve finally managed to place my target&#x2019;s physical location, but my phone&#x2019;s a cracked, beat-up old thing, with an antique battery that&#x2019;s on its last legs. It keeps trying to sleep in order to save energy, and the screen is so dark I can barely see anything.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Wake up,&#x201d; I mutter, squinting at the pixels.<br> &nbsp;<br> Finally, the poor phone lets out a pitiful buzz, and the red location marker updates on my map.<br> &nbsp;<br> I make my way out of the taxi jam and push my heel down on my board. It protests for a moment, but then it speeds me forward, a dot in a sea of moving humanity.<br> &nbsp;<br> Once I reach Times Square, screens tower above me, surrounding me in a world of neon and sound. Every spring, the official Warcross Championships kick off with a huge ceremony, and two teams of top-ranking players compete in an all-stars opening round of Warcross. This year&#x2019;s opening ceremony happens tonight in Tokyo&#x2014;so all the screens are Warcross-related today, showing a frenzied rotation of famous players, commercials, and footage of highlights from last year. Frankie Dena&#x2019;s latest, craziest music video plays on the side of one building. She&#x2019;s dressed like her Warcross avatar&#x2014;in a limited edition suit and webbed glitter cape&#x2014;and dancing with a bunch of businessmen in bright pink suits. Underneath the screen, a group of excited tourists stop to pose for photos with some guy dressed in fake Warcross gear.<br> &nbsp;<br> Another screen features five of the superstar players competing in tonight&#x2019;s opening ceremony. Asher Wing. Kento Park. Jena MacNeil. Max Martin. Penn Wachowski. I crane my neck to admire them. Each one is dressed from head to toe in the hottest fashion of the season. They smile down at me, their mouths big enough to swallow the city, and as I look on, they all hold up cans of soda, declaring Coca-Cola their drink of choice during game season. A marquee of text scrolls below them:<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Top Warcross Players Arrive in Tokyo, Poised for World Domination</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Then I&#x2019;m through the intersection and cut onto a smaller road. My target&#x2019;s little red dot on my phone shifts again. It looks like he&#x2019;s turned onto Thirty-Eighth Street.<br> &nbsp;<br> I squeeze my way through another few blocks of traffic before I finally arrive, pulling over along the curb beside a newsstand. The red location dot now hovers over the building in front of me, right above a caf�&#x2019;s door. I tug my scarf down and let out a sigh of relief. My breath fogs in the icy air. &#x201c;Caught you,&#x201d; I whisper, allowing myself a smile as I think of the five-thousand-dollar bounty. I hop off my electric skateboard, pull out its straps, and swing it over my shoulder so that it bumps against my backpack. It&#x2019;s still warm from use, the heat of it seeping through my hoodie, and I arch my back to savor it.<br> &nbsp;<br> As I pass the newsstand, I glimpse the magazine covers. I have a habit of checking them out, searching for coverage of my favorite person. There&#x2019;s always something. Sure enough, one of the magazines features him prominently: a tall young man lounging in an office, dressed in dark trousers and a crisp collar shirt, sleeves casually rolled up to his elbows, his face obscured by shadows. Below him is the logo for Henka Games, Warcross&#x2019;s parent studio. I stop to read the headline.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>HIDEO TANAKA TURNS 21 | Inside the Private Life of the Warcross Creator</i><br> &nbsp;<br> My heart skips a familiar beat at my idol&#x2019;s name. Too bad there&#x2019;s no time to stop and flip through the magazine. Maybe later. I reluctantly turn away, adjust my backpack and board higher on my shoulders, and pull my hood up to cover my head. The glass windows I pass reflect a distorted vision of myself&#x2014;face elongated, dark jeans stretched too long, black gloves, beat-up boots, faded red scarf wrapped around my black hoodie. My rainbow-colored hair spills out from underneath my hood. I try to imagine this reflected girl printed on the cover of a magazine.<br> &nbsp;<br> Don&#x2019;t be stupid. I push the ridiculous thought away as I head toward the caf�&#x2019;s entrance, shifting my thoughts instead to the running checklist of tools in my backpack.<br><br> 1. Handcuffs<br> 2. Cable launcher<br> 3. Steel-tipped gloves<br> 4. Phone<br> 5. Change of clothes<br> 6. Stun gun<br> 7. Book<br> &nbsp;<br> On one of my first hunts, my target threw up all over me after I used my stun gun (#6) on him. I started bringing a change of clothes (#5) after that. Two targets have managed to bite me, so after a few tetanus shots, I added the gloves (#3). The cable launcher (#2) is for getting to hard-to-reach places and catching hard-to-reach people. My phone (#4) is my portable hacking assistant. Handcuffs (#1) are because, well, obviously.<br> &nbsp;<br> And the book (#7) is for whenever the hunt involves a lot of waiting around. Entertainment that won&#x2019;t eat up my batteries is always worth bringing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now I step into the caf�, soak in the warmth, and check my phone again. Customers are lined up along a counter displaying pastries, waiting for one of the four auto-cashiers to open. Decorative bookshelves line the walls. A smattering of students and tourists sit at the tables. When I point my phone&#x2019;s camera at them, I can see their names hovering over their heads, meaning none of them have set themselves on Private. Maybe my target isn&#x2019;t on this floor.<br> &nbsp;<br> I wander past the shelves, my attention shifting from table to table. Most people never really observe their surroundings; ask anyone what the person sitting at a nearby table was wearing, and chances are good that they can&#x2019;t tell you. But I can. I can recite to you the outfits and demeanor of every person in that coffee line, can tell you exactly how many people are sitting at each table, the precise way someone&#x2019;s shoulders hunch just a little too much, the two people sitting side by side who never say a word, the guy who is careful not to make eye contact with anyone else. I can take in a scene like a photographer might take in a landscape&#x2014;relax my eyes, analyze the full view all at once, search for the point of interest, and take a mental snapshot to remember the whole thing.<br> &nbsp;<br> I look for the break in the pattern, the nail that protrudes.<br> &nbsp;<br> My gaze pauses on a cluster of four boys reading on the couches. I watch them for a while, waiting for signs of conversation or the hint of notes being passed by hand or phone. Nothing. My attention goes to the stairs leading up to the second floor. No doubt other hunters are closing in on this target, too&#x2014;I have to get to him before anyone else does. My steps quicken as I climb the stairs.<br> &nbsp;<br> No one is up here, or so it seems. But then I notice the faint sound of two voices at a table in a far corner, tucked behind a pair of bookshelves that make them almost impossible to see from the stairs. I move in closer on silent feet, then peek through the shelves.<br> &nbsp;<br> A woman is seated at the table, her nose buried in a book. A man stands over her, nervously shuffling his feet. I hold up my phone. Sure enough, both of them are set to Private.<br> &nbsp;<br> I slip to the side of the wall so that they can&#x2019;t see me, and listen closely.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have until tomorrow night,&#x201d; the man is saying.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; the woman replies. &#x201c;But there&#x2019;s not much I can do. My boss won&#x2019;t release that kind of money to you without taking extra security measures, not when the police have an arrest warrant for you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You promised me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m sorry, sir.&#x201d; The woman&#x2019;s voice is calm and cynical, like she&#x2019;s had to say this countless times before. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s game season. The authorities are on high alert.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I have three hundred thousand notes with you. Do you have any idea what that&#x2019;s exchanging for?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes. It&#x2019;s my job to know,&#x201d; the woman answers in the driest voice I&#x2019;ve ever heard.<br> &nbsp;<br> Three hundred thousand notes. That&#x2019;s about two hundred thousand dollars, at the current exchange rate. High roller, this one. Gambling on Warcross is illegal in the United States; it&#x2019;s one of the many laws the government has recently passed in a desperate attempt to keep up with technology and cybercrime. If you win a bet on a Warcross match, you win game credits called notes. But here&#x2019;s the thing&#x2014;you can either take those notes online or to a physical place, where you meet a teller like this lady. You trade your notes to her. She gives you real cash in return, while taking a cut for her boss.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my money,&#x201d; the guy is insisting now.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We have to protect ourselves. Extra security measures take time. You can come back tomorrow night, and we can exchange half of your notes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I told you, I don&#x2019;t have until tomorrow night. I need to leave the city.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The conversation repeats itself all over again. I hold my breath as I listen. The woman has all but confirmed his identity.<br> &nbsp;<br> My eyes narrow, and my lips turn up into a hungry little smirk. This, right here, is the moment I live for during a hunt&#x2014;when the bits and pieces I&#x2019;ve exposed of a trail all converge into a fine point, when I see my target standing physically before me, ripe for the picking. When I&#x2019;ve solved the puzzle.<br> &nbsp;<br> Got you.<br> &nbsp;<br> As their conversation turns more urgent, I tap my phone twice and send out a text message to the police. <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Suspect in physical custody. </i><br> &nbsp;<br> I get a reply almost immediately.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>NYPD ALERTED.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> I pull the stun gun out of my backpack. It catches for an instant against the edge of the zipper, making the faintest scraping sound.<br> &nbsp;<br> The conversation halts. Through the bookshelves, both the man and woman jerk their heads toward me like deer in headlights. The man sees my expression. His face is covered in a sheen of sweat, and his hair is plastered against his forehead. A fraction of a second passes.<br> &nbsp;<br> I shoot.<br> &nbsp;<br> He bolts&#x2014;I miss him by a hair. Good reflexes. The woman darts up from her table, too, but I could care less about her. I rush after him. He hops down the stairs three at a time, nearly falling in his rush, scattering his phone and a bunch of pens behind him. He sprints for the entrance as I reach the first floor. I burst through the revolving glass door right behind him.<br> &nbsp;<br> We emerge onto the street. People let out startled shouts as the man shoves them aside&#x2014;he knocks a camera-clicking tourist flat on her back. In one movement, I swing my electric board off my shoulder, drop it, jump on, and slam my heel down as har...</p><h2>Good Night Beach (Good Night Our World)</h2><p>Good Night Beach features building sand castles by the ocean, boating, swimming, exploring the seashore, waves, tidal pools, surfing, fishing, snorkeling, crabs, seagulls, picnics, campfires, sunsets, and more.

We want it badly, but we often run from it. At some deep level we sense that we have a profound need for intimacy, but we are afraid to go there. Why? <br><br>We avoid intimacy because having intimacy means exposing our secrets. Being intimate means sharing the secrets of our hearts, minds, and souls with another fragile and imperfect human being. Intimacy requires that we allow another person to discover what moves us, what inspires us, what drives us, what eats at us, what we are running toward, what we are running from, what self-destructive enemies lie within us, and what wild and wonderful dreams we hold in our hearts.<br><br> In <i>The Seven Levels of Intimacy</i>, Matthew Kelly teaches us in practical and unforgettable ways how to know these things about ourselves and how to share ourselves more deeply with the people we love. This book will change the way you approach your relationships forever!</p><p>Matthew Kelly is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Rhythm of Life</i> and twenty other books that have been published in more than twenty-five languages and have sold more than 15 million copies.A throwaway buzzword in pop psychology, intimacy remains a litmus test for the health of relationships and is something everyone should strive for, says Kelly, the bestselling author of The Rhythm of Life. "Intimacy is the one thing a person cannot live happily without," he writes. Since many people cling to the "pubescent notion" that intimacy and sex are synonymous, Kelly begins by talking about what intimacy is not-sex, common interests-and proffering up inspirational tidbits and oft heard motivational questions ("Who energizes you?" "Why do they energize you?" "How do you want to be remembered?") before hammering home the thesis of this book: intimacy is a "legitimate need." His seven levels of intimacy-clich�s; facts; opinions; hopes and dreams; feelings; faults, fears and failures; and legitimate needs-each get a chapter-length discussion. Kelly advocates openness-in communication, enduring pain, delaying gratification-and sprinkles in bits of spirituality in cajoling readers to foster intimacy, and, in turn, love and the meaning of life. "Life is about love. It's about whom you love and whom you hurt. Life's about how you love and hurt the people close to you." His view may seem simplistic, but Kelly's simple, direct prose and patient explanations will appeal to spiritual readers. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

(But so are math and reading!) In the first book in this new series, Hank&#39;s class is putting on a play, and Hank wants the lead part: Aqua Fly. But he freezes in his audition and can only buzz like a fly. His teacher creates a special part for Hank, a silent bookmark. This may seem like an insignificant role, but when his enemy, Nick McKelty, freezes during the performance, it&#39;s up to Hank to save the play!</p><p>Henry Winkler is an actor, producer, and director, and he speaks publicly all over the world.

Please stop talking!&#x201d; Ms. Flowers said to me. &#x201c;Good citizens don&#x2019;t talk when the teacher is talking.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But I didn&#x2019;t say anything, Ms. Flowers.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hank, I saw your lips moving with my own two eyes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But no sound came out, Ms. Flowers. So, technically, I wasn&#x2019;t talking.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then what exactly were you doing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was sending a signal.&#x201d;<br><br>The other kids in the class laughed, which made me feel great. I wasn&#x2019;t trying to be funny. But it&#x2019;s always nice to get a laugh. <br><br>&nbsp;My grandfather Papa Pete always says laughter is good, but not as good as a pickle. We&#x2019;re both big pickle fans.<br><br>&#x201c;And to whom was this so-called signal being sent?&#x201d; Ms. Flowers asked.<br><br>&#x201c;To me!&#x201d; Frankie Townsend called out.<br><br>Frankie and I have been best friends since we were babies. We have a whole system of signals.<br><br>&#x201c;We can talk without saying a word,&#x201d; I told Ms. Flowers.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, really?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s very unusual.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There was this one time in the Museum of Natural History,&#x201d; Frankie went on. &#x201c;It was amazing. Hank and I both decided to roar right in the T. rex&#x2019;s face&#x2014;at the very same moment.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was awesome,&#x201d; I added. &#x201c;Until the guard told us there was no roaring allowed in the museum.&#x201d;<br><br>I laughed, and everyone joined in. Ms. Flowers chuckled, too. She&#x2019;s really nice about laughing. <br>Everyone at PS 87 wants her for second grade because she&#x2019;s in a good mood almost all the time. She even gave me a nice try when I only got two out of ten right on <br> my spelling test last week.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, Hank, since you&#x2019;re so expert at roaring and signaling,&#x201d; she said to me, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re going <br> to love our next class project.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can hardly wait to hear what it is. I&#x2019;m sitting on the edge of my seat.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can hardly wait for you to fall off!&#x201d; Nick McKelty shouted from the desk behind me.<br><br>Nick McKelty, better known as Nick the Tick, never has a nice word to say about anyone. But he gets away with it because he&#x2019;s about twelve feet tall&#x2014;in every direction.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s enough, Nick,&#x201d; <br><br>Ms. Flowers snapped, putting her hands on her hips. But McKelty didn&#x2019;t seem to care that she was angry. He just went back to what he always does&#x2014;rolling spitballs to launch at the little kids during recess.<br><br>&#x201c;Next week is Children&#x2019;s Reading Week,&#x201d; Ms. Flowers went on. &#x201c;We will be celebrating by putting on a play. I wrote it myself. It&#x2019;s called A Night at the Library.&#x201d;<br><br>Katie Sperling put up her hand and waved it around.<br><br>&#x201c;Can I be the star?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;My daddy always tells me I am one, anyway.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Everyone will have a part,&#x201d; Ms. Flowers said.<br><br>&#x201c;Even me?&#x201d; Luke Whitman asked, with his finger up his nose.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, even you, Luke.&#x201d;<br><br>I wondered if there was a part in the play for a champion nose-picker. Luke Whitman would get that for sure!<br><br>&#x201c;I think we all know who&#x2019;s going to be the star!&#x201d; McKelty shouted out. &#x201c;The one with the most talent. And that would be me.&#x201d;<br><br>Then, for no reason at all, he stood up and bowed, and let out one of his snorty laughs. No one else joined in.<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m now going to pass out the script,&#x201d; Ms. Flowers said, motioning for McKelty to sit down. &#x201c;Read the play over the weekend and decide on which part you&#x2019;d like.&#x201d;<br><br>I felt worried. Really worried. Regular second-grade reading is hard for me. Reading a whole script would be nearly impossible.<br><br>Frankie saw my face and sent me our &#x201c;don&#x2019;t worry&#x201d; signal. I relaxed right away, because I knew he would help me. Frankie is an excellent reader. Over winter break, he read a two-hundred-page book that didn&#x2019;t even have pictures.<br><br>&#x201c;We will hold auditions on Monday,&#x201d; Ms. Flowers told us. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s when you can each try <br> out for the part you want.&#x201d;<br><br>Even though I knew Frankie would help me, I was starting to get very nervous.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to study your lines and be very prepared,&#x201d; Ms. Flowers continued. &#x201c;Does anyone have any questions?&#x201d;<br><br>As usual, I had many questions. Also as usual, I was too embarrassed to ask them. So I did what <br>I usually did&#x2014;<br><br> I made a list in my head.<br> &nbsp;<br><b> (Chapter 2)</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Questions I Have about the Play <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (That I&#x2019;m Too Afraid To Ask)<br> by Hank Zipzer<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> 1. Will I be any good at this?<br> 2. I mean, will I really be any <br> good at this?<br> 3. What if I&#x2019;m not good at this?<br> 4. Can you throw up during an audition and still get the part?<br> 5. And the big question: Will I be any good at this? Oh, I already said that.<br> &nbsp;<br><b> (Chapter 3)<br></b><br> After school that day, Papa Pete picked up Frankie and me. Frankie&#x2019;s mom is a yoga instructor, and she teaches every Friday afternoon. She is so good at yoga that she can lift her foot off the floor and squeeze her nose with her toes like they&#x2019;re a swimmer&#x2019;s clip. <br> While Frankie&#x2019;s mom&#x2019;s teaching, Papa Pete takes Frankie and me to the Crunchy Pickle. That&#x2019;s the deli on 77th Street and Broadway that Papa Pete used to own. Now my mom is taking it over and trying to turn it into a healthy sandwich shop. <br><br>That is very bad news for salami.<br><br>As we walked toward the Crunchy Pickle, Frankie and I couldn&#x2019;t stop talking about the play. <br>Actually, I did all the talking, and Frankie did all the listening.<br><br>&#x201c;I was in a play once when <br><br>I was your age,&#x201d; Papa Pete said when I finally took a breath.<br><br>&#x201c;Were you the star?&#x201d; I asked him.<br><br>&#x201c;Not exactly. I played a tube of toothpaste, but it was a very important tube. Harold Dunski was the star. He was lucky enough to get the part of Mr.&nbsp;Toothbrush.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s so lucky about that?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you kidding, Hankie?&#x201d; Papa Pete said. &#x201c;Harold got to sing the big opening number. It was called &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t Forget to Flush and Brush.&#x2019; The girls went crazy. In fact, years later he married the girl who played the sink.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No offense, Papa Pete,&#x201d; Frankie said, &#x201c;but this is kind of a disgusting story.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m just pointing out that being in a play is a lot of fun, but it&#x2019;s also a lot of work. You have rehearsals to go to, lines to memorize . . . &#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the part that scares me the most,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m pretty bad at memorizing. I can&#x2019;t even remember how to spell neighbor.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be so hard on yourself, Hankie,&#x201d; Papa Pete said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re clever. You&#x2019;ll figure it out.&#x201d;<br> I wasn&#x2019;t so sure he was right about that.<br><br>We had reached the entrance to the Crunchy Pickle. Papa Pete pulled open the glass door. Frankie and I dashed to the counter that held the black-and-white cookies. They&#x2019;ve been our favorite ever since I can remember. Just before we grabbed two, my mom came out from the back room.<br><br>&#x201c;Whoa there, mister,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;No cookies until you&#x2019;ve had a healthy snack. I have some fresh soylami right here.&#x201d;<br><br>My mom is trying to bring luncheon meats into the twenty-first century. She <br> makes everything out of soy. Soylami, which tastes nothing like salami. Soystrami, which makes your tongue want to go home without eating. And the worst is soyloney, which doesn&#x2019;t even look like baloney. In fact, it&#x2019;s yellow. <br><br>&#x201c;Mom!&#x201d; I protested. &#x201c;Frankie and I have a lot of work to do, and we need real brain food.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Look at your sister,&#x201d; she answered. &#x201c;See how nicely she&#x2019;s sitting in that front booth enjoying her soy-meat platter?&#x201d;<br><br>My sister, Emily, who is in the first grade, does everything perfectly. It&#x2019;s just like her to enjoy fake meat. She also likes doing her homework, reading about lizards, clipping her toenails, and getting all As. She is so annoying. <br><br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you boys find a seat,&#x201d; Papa Pete said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll make you a real sandwich, with some pickles on the side.&#x201d;<br><br>Papa Pete is just the best. He saves the day, every day.<br><br>Frankie and I slid into a booth far away from Emily. We reached into our backpacks and each pulled out a copy of the play. As soon as I turned to the first page, my brain froze like <br> a Popsicle.<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t read this,&#x201d; I said to Frankie. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s too many words.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes you can, Hank. Let&#x2019;s go very slowly.&#x201d;<br><br>Frankie read the summary of the story.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s about a boy named Barry who falls asleep in the library,&#x201d; he explained. &#x201c;While he&#x2019;s asleep, the books come alive and jump off the shelves.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wow, that sounds great. Does it say what kinds of books?&#x201d;<br><br>Frankie nodded. &#x201c;The books are all the characters the class is going to play. Look, there&#x2019;s <br> a book on volcanoes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;d be great for Luke Whitman,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;His nose is always full of lava.&#x201d; We cracked up, and Frankie went on.<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see. There&#x2019;s a biography of Martin Luther King Jr. And a mystery story called The Secret of Big Bear Lake. Here&#x2019;s a scary one called My Babysitter Is a Zombie. And look at this weird one&#x2014;The History of Shoes Up to the Flip-Flop. You interested in that part?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said, shaking my head. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stand anything between my toes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, this book is cool,&#x201d; Frankie said, pointing to some words on the page. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a superhero comic book called Aqua Fly. It&#x2019;s about a fly that lives in an underwater cave.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s perfect for me!&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going for that part. What about you, Frankie?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think I&#x2019;d be good at playing Barry. I like to read in the library. And I&#x2019;m really good at falling asleep.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Great, then we both know what we want,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get to work.&#x201d;<br><br>I flipped through my script. All the words started to swim on the pages. I was hoping that Aqua Fly didn&#x2019;t have too many words to say. Maybe he would just fly and buzz. I could buzz for thirty-seven minutes straight if I had to.<br><br>Unfortunately, Aqua Fly was pretty talkative. As I tried to read all his lines, I could feel my brain start to swirl. After a few more pages, it felt like all I had in my head was soggy oatmeal. <br><br>&#x201c;Here are your sandwiches, boys,&#x201d; Papa Pete said, sliding our plates onto the table next to the scripts.<br><br>Boy, oh, boy. I was never so glad to see a turkey sandwich and a pickle. They didn&#x2019;t have to read me, and I didn&#x2019;t have to read them. All I had to do was eat. And I am a champion eater.</p><h2>Spaghetti and Meatballs For All! (Scholastic Bookshelf)</h2><p>Mr. and Mrs. Comfort are having a family reunion! Mr. Comfort starts cooking up his famous spaghetti and meatballs, while Mrs. Comfort carefully arranges eight tables and thirty-two chairs so that everyone will have a seat. The tables look lovely, the food is ready, and here come the guests--with their own seating plans!<br>This delightful Marilyn Burns Brainy Day Book uses wit and humor to draw children into thinking about area and perimeter.</p><p>Author and math teacher Marilyn Burns is noted for her many books that instill an interest and enthusiasm for mathematics into her school-age readers. Her books use traditional and original literature to address mathematical concepts. In addition to her instructive children&#x2019;s books Marilyn is the author of many books for teachers. She has also written books for children about food, time, and Hanukkah. She says that her writing career began as a &#x201c;fluke&#x201d; when a friend asked her to write a book about math. This was the jumping off point for her literary career, during which she has written about a dozen books for children and the same number for teachers. She currently gives lectures and lessons in schools. Burns was born in 1941 and resides in Sausalito, CA.Grade 2-4?Mr. and Mrs. Comfort decide to have a family dinner and invite their children, parents, in-laws, and neighbors. To seat the 32 guests, eight square tables and the appropriate number of chairs are rented and arranged according to a plan devised by Mrs. Comfort. However, as the guests arrive, they rearrange the furniture so they can sit together, resulting in mayhem until Mrs. Comfort's original configuration once again evolves. Subtitled "A Mathematical Story," the focus of this picture book is math concepts, not story. A note for adults suggests exercises in shapes and perimeter. Somewhat humorous, sketchy cartoons are busy and cluttered as guests of various ages and ethnicity rearrange furnishings, table settings, and food. While teachers might find this title useful for conveying math ideas, it is not a necessary purchase for most libraries.?Virginia Opocensky, formerly at Lincoln City Libraries, NE<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Bad Kitty Does Not Like Candy</h2><p>Kitty wants to eat all of the candy.

This was the beginning of the Bastien piano books that have inspired so many piano students and teachers.<br><br>The Bastien piano books have been published worldwide by the Neil A. Kjos Music Company since 1963 and are now translated into 14 languages.

She is friendless, outcast, because she busted an end-of-summer party by calling the cops, so now nobody will talk to her, let alone listen to her. As time passes, she becomes increasingly isolated and practically stops talking altogether. </p><p>Only her art class offers any solace, and it is through her work on an art project that she is finally able to face what really happened at that terrible party: she was raped by an upperclassman, a guy who still attends Merryweather and is still a threat to her. Her healing process has just begun when she has another violent encounter with him. But this time Melinda fights back, refuses to be silent, and thereby achieves a measure of vindication. </p><p><b>Praise for <i>Speak</i>:</b></p><p>&#x201c;In a stunning first novel, Anderson uses keen observations and vivid imagery to pull readers into the head of an isolated teenager. . . . <b>Will leave readers touched and inspired</b>.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, <b>starred review</b></p><p>&#x201c;An uncannily funny book even as it plumbs the darkness, <i>Speak</i> will hold readers from first word to last.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<i>The Horn Book</i>, <b>starred review</b></p><p><b>Accolades for <i>Speak</i>:</b></p><p><i>New York Times </i>Bestseller<br><i>Publishers Weekly </i>Bestseller<br>Michael L.

She lives in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania.Kindergarten-Grade 3&#x2013;The Siamese cat from <i>Skippyjon Jones</i> (Dutton, 2003) that thinks he's a Chihuahua returns in another adventure. Sent to his room by his mother for drawing on the walls, the feline puts on a mask and cape and then sings in a Spanish accent: "Oh, my name is Skippito Friskito/And I heard from a leetle birdito/That the doggies have fled/From the gobbling head/Who goes by the name Bobble-ito!" He then boards his skateboard and rolls into his closet, eventually arriving at a shack where he finds his Chihuahua friends. They explain that their home has been invaded ("Yesterday morning we left the house to buy some beans...when we returned, a Bobble-ito was in la casa perrito") and ask for his help. He solves the problem by grabbing the intruder and stuffing it into his pants. At story's end, Mama checks on Skippyjon and finds him wrapped in a blanket and talking to his sister's bobblehead doll. Schachner's ink-and-acrylic illustrations create the madcap surrealistic world Skippyjon inhabits, but the narrative offers little more than bad verse, confused plotting, and Taco Bell-style expressions&#x2013;a fact underscored by the accompanying CD of the author reading her two Skippyjon tales.

That day, Welles made a fearless choice and in doing so, saved many lives. <br><br> The survivors didn&#x2019;t know his name, but one of them remembered a single detail clearly: the man was wearing a red bandanna.

That&#x2019;s Tasty.<br><br><i>Latest &amp; Greatest </i>is just that: what we&#x2019;ve been working on lately and what you&#x2019;ve been loving lately.

Next up? Country-fare like sliders (four types, so everyone&#x2019;s happy); beer can chicken, because it&#x2019;s probably one of our nation&#x2019;s greatest culinary&#x2014;heck, why stop there?&#x2014;and historical accomplishments; and Mexican-style tacos that may have you dreaming of opening your own street cart. A whole dessert chapter filled with genius hacks like baking tortillas into bowls and using sweetened condensed milk to make Brazilian chocolate truffles. Classic dishes also take center stage in a chapter featuring pillowy homemade gnocchi (yeah, you can do it!); chicken-and-mushroom marsala; and a pot pie whose biggest demand of you is a pie crust. We don&#x2019;t forget about our vegetarians, with killer dishes that will fill you up with substance and with pride, such as zucchini &#x201c;meat&#x201d;balls, a vegan mac &#x2019;n&#x2019; cheese, and buffalo cauliflower that proves you don&#x2019;t need to wing it. Any chapter called Best Ever is, well, the best ever&#x2014;how could it not be with fried chicken drizzled with honey; super-chewy chocolate chip cookies; and three-ingredient ice cream (we promise&#x2014;just three!). We also take you globetrotting with a chapter of around-the-world choices that bring far-flung flavors home; think homemade dumplings (you make the dough yourself&#x2014;go you!); chicken tikka masala (the secret is heavy cream!); and bulgogi, a Korean dish that&#x2019;s easier to make than pronounce (it&#x2019;s bull-GOghee, in case you&#x2019;re wondering). Trends are fine and all, but they have to hold their own, and ours do: a cheesecake with a crackling cereal crust is a keeper no matter what the year, and emoji fries are just so darn cute.

Get ready to have a great time.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Chicken Satay Skewers&nbsp;</b><br><br>SERVES 4<br><br>If you ever wondered how to make this pu pu platter fave, you&#x2019;re in luck! It starts with a peanutty marinade that benefits from the zing of fresh hot chilies and ginger (you can sub in 1 teaspoon chili flakes and 2 teaspoons powdered ginger in a pinch). Though they&#x2019;re great after two hours of marinating, an overnight soak gets you incredibly flavorful, tender chicken. Bonus: the reserved marinade gets boiled down with creamy coconut milk, creating a thick sauce that just might make double-dipping okay again.&nbsp;<br><br>MARINADE <br>3/4 cup creamy peanut butter <br>3/4 cup coconut milk <br>4 spring onions, roughly chopped <br>3 garlic cloves, peeled <br>2-inch piece of ginger, peeled <br>2 fresh Serrano chilies, roughly chopped <br>1 teaspoon curry powder <br>1 teaspoon cumin <br>1 teaspoon turmeric <br>1 teaspoon salt <br>2 tablespoons soy sauce <br>Juice of 1 lime <br><br>8 boneless, skinless chicken thighs, diced <br>SAUCE <br>1/2 cup peanuts, chopped <br>1/2 cup coconut milk <br><br>Bamboo or wooden skewers<br><br>1. In a food processor, blend all the marinade ingredients into a smooth paste; this should make about 2 cups. Reserve half of the marinade and pour the other half over the chicken thighs. Mix and chill for 2 hours or overnight.<br><br>2. Preheat the oven to 425&#x2da;F (220&#x2da;C). Line a baking tray with parchment paper.<br><br>3. Skewer the marinated chicken onto bamboo skewers, then arrange the skewers so their ends rest on the edges of the baking tray, allowing the chicken to be suspended. Bake the chicken skewers for 15 to 20&nbsp;minutes, until slightly dark brown on the edges and cooked throughout.&nbsp;<br><br>4. With no oil in the pan, toast the chopped peanuts on low to medium heat, stirring constantly until the peanuts turn golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add in the reserved marinade and the coconut milk. Stir and cook until thick and very aromatic, 5 to 10 minutes.<br><br>5. Serve the chicken skewers with the sauce on the side.</p><h2>Fairest of All (Whatever After #1) (1)</h2><p><b>The first installment of Sarah Mylowski's <i>New York Times</i> bestselling series!<br><br>Be the bravest of them all . . .</b><br><br>Once upon a time my brother and I were normal kids.

The first were about a little girl named Sarah who lived in Montreal, just like I did, but magic stuff happened to her, like she had a magic umbrella and could fly, or a magic fork that could turn vegetables into chocolate. The second were fractured fairy tales. Since I was not a fan of vegetables, when my mom told me the story of "The Princess and the Pea", the queen put Smarties under the girl's mattress to see if she was a true princess. When I became a writer I wondered: What if I combined the two? What if a regular girl magically fell into a fairy tale and fractured it? And that's how I got the idea for my new series, Whatever After.</p>Sarah Mlynowski is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Whatever After series, the Magic in Manhattan series, <i>Gimme a Call</i>, and a bunch of other books for tweens and teens, including the Upside-Down Magic series, which she cowrites with Lauren Myracle and Emily Jenkins. Originally from Montreal, Sarah now lives in the kingdom of Manhattan with her very own prince charming and their fairy tale-loving daughters.

Then, to stop this problem, Captain Bunn takes the reader step-by-step through exercises that permanently and automatically control these feelings. He also explains how flying works, why it is safe, and teaches flyers how to strategically plan their flight, choose the right airlines, meet the captain, and so on.&nbsp;Through this program, Captain Bunn has helped thousands overcome their fear of flying.

Hope for a cure abounds. Celebrities have come forward to share their experiences and raise awareness. Chances are you know someone who has had it.</p><p>But did you know that you make choices every day that bring you closer to breast cancer&#x2014;or move you farther away? That in the majority of cases, cancer isn&#x2019;t up to fate, and there are ways to reduce your risk factors? That many of the things you&#x2019;ve heard regarding the causes of breast cancer are flat out false?</p><p>There have been few solid guidelines on how to improve your breast health, lower your risk of getting cancer, optimize your outcomes if you&#x2019;re faced with a diagnosis, and make informed medical choices after treatment.

As someone who has faced breast cancer, I suggest you follow it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Robin Roberts, Coanchor, <em>Good Morning America</em></p></p><p><p>Dr. Kristi Funk is a board-certified breast surgeon who, alongside her husband, Andy Funk, cofounded the Pink Lotus Breast Center in Los Angeles.&nbsp; She has helped thousands of women through breast cancer treatment, including well-known celebrities like Angelina Jolie and Sheryl Crow.&nbsp; Dr. Funk is a frequent cohost on&nbsp;<em>The Doctors&nbsp;</em>and breast expert on&nbsp;<em>Good Morning America,&nbsp;</em>and has appeared on&nbsp;<em>The View, Today, The Dr. Oz Show,&nbsp;</em>CNN, and numerous other national and local television and news shows.&nbsp; She lives in Southern California with her husband and triplet sons.&nbsp;</p>From Publishers Weekly - Breast cancer surgeon Funk offers a comprehensive and empowering approach to breast care and breast cancer in this well-written manual. Although Funk (who performed actress Angelina Jolie&#39;s widely publicized double prophylactic mastectomy) spends a good portion of the book on breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, she also provides a wealth of tips on how women can decrease their risk of developing the disease. The extensive research she shares can be overwhelming, but she lightens things up with jocular comments and blunt asides (quit smoking now, she advises, or you will look &#39;ugly at your own funeral&#39;). While her subject is weighty, Funk&#39;s voice is empowering and inspirational: she urges women to make lifestyle choices that will improve their odds for not getting breast cancer, including cutting out or limiting meat in favor of a plant-based diet. Though she produces numbers showing breast cancer on the rise worldwide, Funk asserts her goal is not to &#39;scare&#39; but to &#39;incentivize&#39; readers. This information-packed manual will be of value to women of all ages and all stages of life, and certainly to those who have been touched by breast cancer.

The document also shows paper chart symbols used by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and symbols specified by the International Hydrographic Organization. In the back of U.S. Chart 1, there is additional information about the characteristics and appearance of buoys conforming to the IALA Maritime Buoyage System that is used by the United States and most other seafaring nations. Some of the changes implemented in this new addition are listed in the table below. Chart No. 1 Symbol Change Description C 21 Extended use of the dashed Intermediate River line symbol to also represent Intermediate Lakes. D 11 Added new NOAA light gray line symbol for Hard Surface Road. F 29.2 Added symbol for Bubble Curtain. Also called a pneumatic barrier, these consist of perforated pipe affixed near shore to the bottom of a body of water. As air is forced through the pipe, rising bubbles cause a wall of water to flow upward. The effect can stop or slow the passage of spilled oil or fish from passing through the barrier. H r H s Deleted entries for obsolete New Moon and Full Moon symbols, which at one time accompanied chart tide tables. H t Deleted entry for Current Diagram symbol, also called a current rose. These symbols are being removed on the next editions of the few charts in New England in which they currently appear. K 47 Deleted the text based Oyster Bed symbol. NOAA now uses the international symbol for Shellfish Bed. K a Changed description of this symbol from &#34;Rock awash&#34; to &#34;Rock which covers and uncovers, (height unknown)&#34; to align with K 11, which shows the same feature, but for which a height is known. N 12.2 N 12.3 Added typical NOAA representations for Anchorages that reference the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Text of relevant sections of the CFR are reprinted in Chapter 2 of each volume of the US Coast Pilot�. N 13 Deleted text based symbol for Seaplane Operating Area. P 30.1 P 40.1 Deleted the symbols shown for NOAA and NGA, which were incorrect. Both agencies portray Directional and Sector Lights in a manner similar to that shown by the international symbols. Q 51-53 Q 55-57 Q 59-63 Deleted entries for many specific types of Special Purpose Buoys and added the note, &#34;Purpose of buoy may be shown by label.&#34; Q 130.1 Added the Island of Taiwan to the list of western Pacific areas, which use the IALA B buoyage system. Q 130.7 Deleted the Q 63 entry for &#34;Emergency wreck marking buoy&#34; and moved the renamed aid, &#34;New danger mark&#34; to Q 130.7. Paper chart and ECDIS symbols are now shown, as well as a depiction of the buoy in Appendix 1. S 4 S 5 Deleted NOAA symbols for Radar Reflectors, which are not shown on NOAA charts. S 18.1-7 Added paper chart and ECDIS examples for each type of Virtual Automatic Identification System (V-AIS) aid to navigation symbol. T 26 T27 Deleted entries for Distress Signal Station and Telegraph Station. Other types of Signal Stations remain. Appendix 1 Added depiction of a New Danger Mark in the appendix that shows examples of the aids to navigation in the IALA Maritime Buoyage System. A New Danger Mark entry was also added at Q 130.7.</p><p></p><h2>Love, Stargirl (Stargirl Series)</h2><p><p><b>The <i>New York Times</i> bestselling sequel to Newbery Medalist Jerry Spinelli&#x2019;s modern-day classic <i>Stargirl</i>!</b><i><br></i></p><p><i>Love, Stargirl </i>picks up a year after <i>Stargirl </i>ends and reveals the new life of the beloved character who moved away so suddenly at the end of <i>Stargirl</i>.

If I were in charge of calendars, every day would be January 1.<br><br>And what better way to celebrate this New Year&#x2019;s Day than to begin writing a letter to my once (and future?) boyfriend.<br><br>I found something today. Something special. The thing is, it&#x2019;s been right in front of me ever since we moved here last year, but today is the first time I really saw it. It&#x2019;s a field. A plain old vacant field. No house in view except a little white stucco bungalow off to the right. It&#x2019;s a mile out of town, a one-minute bike ride from my house. It&#x2019;s on a hill&#x2014;the flat top of a hill shaped like an upside-down frying pan. It used to be a pick-your-own-strawberries patch, but now it grows only weeds and rocks.<br><br>The field is on the other side of Route 113, which is where my street (Rapps Dam Road) dead-ends. I&#x2019;ve biked past this field a hundred times, but for some reason today I stopped. I looked at it. I parked my bike and walked into it. The winter weeds were scraggly and matted down, like my hair in the morning. The frozen ground was cloddy and rock-hard. The sky was gray. I walked to the center and just stood there.<br><br>And stood.<br><br>How can I explain it? Alone, on the top of that hill, in the middle of that &#x201c;empty&#x201d; field (Ha!&#x2014;write this down, Leo: nothing is empty), I felt as if the universe radiated from me, as if I were standing on the X that marked the center of the cosmos. Until then I had done my daily meditation in many different places in and around town, but never here. Now I did. I sat down. I barely noticed the cold ground. I held my hands on my thighs, palms up to the world. I closed my eyes and dissolved out of myself. I now call it washing my mind.<br><br>The next thing I noticed was a golden tinge beyond my eyelids. I opened my eyes. The sun was seeping through the clouds. It was setting over the treetops in the west. I closed my eyes again and let the gold wash over me.<br><br>Night was coming on when I got up. As I headed for my bike, I knew I had found an enchanted place.<br><br>January 3<br><br>Oh, Leo, I&#x2019;m sad. I&#x2019;m crying. I used to cry a lot when I was little. If I stepped on a bug I&#x2019;d burst into tears. Funny thing&#x2014;I was so busy crying for everything else, I never cried for myself. Now I cry for me.<br><br>For you.<br><br>For us.<br><br>And now I&#x2019;m smiling through my tears. Remember the first time I saw you? In the lunchroom? I was walking toward your table. Your eyes&#x2014;that&#x2019;s what almost stopped me in my tracks. They boggled. I think it wasn&#x2019;t just the sight of me&#x2014;long frontier dress, ukulele sticking out of my sunflower shoulder sack&#x2014;it was something else too. It was terror. You knew what was coming. You knew I was going to sing to someone, and you were terrified it might be you. You quick looked away, and I breezed on by and didn&#x2019;t stop until I found Alan Ferko and sang &#x201c;Happy Birthday&#x201d; to him. But I felt your eyes on me the whole time, Leo. Oh yes! Every second. And with every note I sang to Alan Ferko I thought: Someday I&#x2019;m going to sing to that boy with the terrified eyes. I never did sing to you, Leo, not really. You, of all people. It&#x2019;s my biggest regret. . . . Now, see, I&#x2019;m sad again.<br><br>January 10<br><br>As I said last week, I wash my mind all over the place. Since the idea&#x2014;and ideal&#x2014;is to erase myself from wherever and whenever I am, I think I should not allow myself to become too attached to any one location, not even Enchanted Hill, as I call it now, or to any particular time of day or night.<br><br>So that&#x2019;s why this morning I was riding my bike in search of a new place to meditate. Cinnamon was hitching a ride in my pocket. As I rode past a cemetery a splash of brightness caught my eye. It was a man sitting in a chair in front of a gravestone. At least I think it was a man, he was so bundled up against the cold. The bright splash was the red and yellow plaid scarf he wore around his neck. He seemed to be talking.<br><br>Before long I found myself back near my house, in a park called Bemus. I climbed onto a picnic table and got into my meditation position. (OK, back up . . . I&#x2019;m homeschooling again. Gee, I wonder why&#x2014;my Mica High School experience went so well! Ha ha. So I have to meet all the state requirements, right?&#x2014;math, English, etc. Which I do. But I don&#x2019;t stop there. I have other courses too. Unofficial ones. Like Principles of Swooning. Life Under Rocks. Beginner&#x2019;s Whistling. Elves. We call it our shadow curriculum. ((Don&#x2019;t tell the State of&#x2014;oops, almost told you what state I&#x2019;m living in.)) My favorite shadow subject is Elements of Nothingness. That&#x2019;s where the mind wash comes in. Totally wiping myself out. Erasing myself. (((Remember the lesson I gave you in the desert?))) Which, when you think about it, is really not nothing. I mean, when I&#x2019;m really doing it right, getting myself totally erased, I&#x2019;m the opposite of nothing&#x2014;I&#x2019;m everything. I&#x2019;m everything but myself. I&#x2019;ve evaporated like water vapor into the universe. I am no longer Stargirl. I am tree. Wind. Earth.)<br><br>OK, sorry for the detour (and parenthetical overkill). . . . So there I was, sitting cross-legged on the picnic table, eyes closed, washing my mind (and getting school credit for it!), and suddenly I felt something on my eyelid. Probably a bug, I thought, and promptly washed away the thought, and the something on my eyelid just became part of everything else. But then the something moved. It traced across my eyelid and went down my nose and around the outline of my lips.</p><h2>What Was the Berlin Wall?</h2><p><b><b>The Berlin Wall finally came down in 1989. Now readers can find out why it was built in the first place; and what it meant for Berliners living on either side of it. Here's the fascinating story of a city</b> <b>divided.</b></b><br><br>In 1961, overnight a concrete border went up, dividing the city of Berlin into two parts - East and West. . The story of the Berlin Wall holds up a mirror to post-WWII politics and the Cold War Era when the United States and the USSR were enemies, always on the verge of war. The wall meant that no one from Communist East Berlin could travel to West Berlin, a free, democratic area. Of course that didn't stop thousands from trying to breech the wall - more than one hundred of them dying in the attempt. (One East Berliner actually ziplined to freedom!) Author Nico Medina explains the spy-vs-spy politics of the time as well as what has happened since the removal of one of the most divisive landmarks in modern history.</p><p>Nico Medina is the author of several Who HQ books, including<i> What Was Stonewall?, Where Is Mount Everest</i>?, <i>Where Is Alcatraz</i>?, <i>Who Is Aretha Franklin?</i>, and <i>What Was the Ice Age?</i><b>What Was the Berlin Wall?</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Peter Fechter was born in Berlin, the capital city of Germany, in 1944. That was just before the end of World War II. After the war, Germany was divided into eastern and western parts. So was the city of Berlin. Peter grew up on the east side of the city.<br> &nbsp;<br> When Peter was twelve, his oldest sister got married and moved to West Berlin. Two years later, Peter left school and began working as a bricklayer. He hoped to save up enough money to join his sister in West Berlin one day. There were better jobs there, and Peter longed for a better life.<br> &nbsp;<br> For many years, the border between East and West Berlin had been relatively open. Half a million Berliners crossed back and forth every day. Twelve thousand children traveled from East Berlin to West Berlin, to go to school. Even the city&#x2019;s subway lines crossed the border.<br> &nbsp;<br> But on August 13, 1961, Peter&#x2019;s dreams of moving to West Berlin were shattered. Suddenly, a wall was built to separate the east and west sides of the city. It was put up by the East Germans. Now, no East Berliners were allowed into West Berlin. The Berlin Wall separated friends and families. People lost their jobs. East Berliners became prisoners in their own city.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1962, eighteen-year-old Peter decided to escape from East Berlin.<br> &nbsp;<br> Peter&#x2019;s friend and coworker Helmut Kulbeik also wanted to leave. Over their lunch breaks that summer, the two young men looked for places along the Wall where they might be able to escape into the West. In time, they found a run-down factory. It was only twelve yards from the Wall and just might work.<br> &nbsp;<br> After lunch on August 17, Peter and Helmut sneaked into the building. They planned to wait until nightfall to escape. But around 2:00 p.m., Peter and Helmut heard voices in the factory. They decided to make a run for it, even though it was still daytime.<br> &nbsp;<br> Peter climbed out a small window. As Helmut began to follow, someone entered the room and spotted him. The stranger turned and left without a word. Had they been caught?<br> &nbsp;<br> Helmut scrambled out the window. Peter and Helmut jumped over some barbed wire. Then they sprinted across the &#x201c;death strip,&#x201d; the heavily guarded area just before the eight-foot-high Wall.<br> &nbsp;<br> Without warning, two East German guards began shooting. Helmut reached the Wall. He leaped up and hoisted himself over. Before dropping over the edge, he looked back at his friend. Peter stood frozen, as if in shock.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Go on with it, jump!&#x201d; Helmut yelled, before dropping into the West and escaping to freedom.<br> &nbsp;<br> Peter was not so lucky. A moment later, he was shot and fell to the ground.<br> &nbsp;<br> A crowd of West Berliners gathered at the Wall. They could hear Peter. &#x201c;Why aren&#x2019;t you helping me?&#x201d; he cried out to them. A police officer scaled the Wall and dropped some bandages, but Peter was too weak to move.<br> &nbsp;<br> Since the end of World War II, American soldiers had been stationed in West Berlin. But now they were under strict orders never to help East Berliners escape. To do so could be seen as an act of war. And no one wanted to start World War III.<br> &nbsp;<br> The East German border guards could have helped Peter, but they didn&#x2019;t. Soon, Peter was dead. &#x201c;You criminals!&#x201d; the crowd, now in the hundreds, screamed over the Wall at the East Germans. &#x201c;You murderers!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Four East German border guards took away Peter&#x2019;s body. Journalists snapped photographs, capturing the grim scene for the world to see.<br> &nbsp;<br> The guards were later presented with a special flag by Walter Ulbricht, the East German leader. Ulbricht also honored the guards with the title &#x201c;Best Border Unit of the Year.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Peter Fechter wasn&#x2019;t the first person to die trying to flee East Berlin. And he would not be the last. The Berlin Wall was barely one year old when Peter was killed. It would stand for another twenty-seven years, and claim at least 140 lives.<br> &nbsp;<br> Why was the Berlin Wall built in the first place?<br> &nbsp;<br> And what, in the end, finally brought it down?<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 1:&nbsp;&#x201c;You Must Go to Berlin&#x201d;</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Over the centuries, the city of Berlin has had its share of ups and downs. It began more than 800 years ago, around the year 1200, and prospered until a war broke out between European Catholics and Protestants in the early 1600s. Much of the city was destroyed, and its population fell by almost half. But Berlin rebounded by welcoming immigrants and people from different religious backgrounds.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1701, Berlin became the capital of the kingdom of Prussia. (Germany did not exist yet.) As the Prussian king grew his army, Berlin grew, too. A grand entrance leading to the king&#x2019;s palace called the Brandenburg Gate was completed in 1791. This majestic landmark still stands today.<br> &nbsp;<br> By the 1800s, Berlin had become a magnet for artists and creative people. The lyrics to a popular song at the time said: &#x201c;You are crazy, my child. You must go to Berlin.&#x201d; Colleges and universities opened, attracting scholars and philosophers from across Europe.<br> &nbsp;<br> During the Industrial Revolution of the early 1800s, steam power changed Berlin&#x2014;and the world&#x2014;forever. Railroads and factories opened throughout the city. Berlin became a center of business and industry, and people flocked there for work.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1871, Prussian prime minister Otto von Bismarck announced there was now a united German Empire. Berlin was the capital of a mighty European power. By 1914, more than two million people called the city home.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then World War I broke out in 1914. Germany invaded Belgium and France. They attempted a naval blockade of Great Britain.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1915, a German submarine sank the passenger ship <i>Lusitania</i>, killing 1,198 people, including 128 Americans. The Germans thought victory would come quickly. But the war dragged on until 1918, killing as many as twenty million people. When Germany finally surrendered, it was in ruins. Wilhelm II, emperor of Germany, stepped down, ending five hundred years of royal rule. World War I brought down many monarchies across Europe.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1919, Germany formed its first democratic government. It was called the Weimar Republic, named after the city where its constitution was written. Although Berlin was almost two hundred miles from Weimar, it was the Weimar Republic&#x2019;s capital and center of culture. Artists, scientists, and intellectuals were drawn to the city.<br> &nbsp;<br> Literature, theater, music, dance, art, architecture, science, and film flourished in Weimar-era Berlin. Albert Einstein won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. Caf�s and nightclubs hosted poetry readings and played jazz. A vibrant gay and lesbian social scene emerged, decades before it would in the United States.<br> &nbsp;<br> Still, the German economy struggled. Crime and unemployment were high. The good times in Berlin&#x2014;and all of Germany&#x2014;came crashing down with the Great Depression in 1929.<br> &nbsp;<br> Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party wrongly blamed Germany&#x2019;s problems on communists and Jews. Many people agreed with him, however, and the Nazis quickly gained power. Albert Einstein, a Jew, fled Germany and never returned.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> When Hitler was named chancellor (or leader) in 1933, his supporters celebrated with a torch-lit march through the Brandenburg Gate. Life in Berlin changed quickly under Nazi rule, as it did all over Germany. Communist groups and other political parties were banned. Freedom of speech and freedom of the press were ended. Hitler&#x2019;s supporters arrested, beat up, and even killed his political enemies.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jews were hit hardest. Jewish professors lost their jobs, and Jewish businesses were taken away from their owners. German Jews were forced to wear patches showing the Star of David&#x2014;a symbol of their faith&#x2014;to identify them to other Germans.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hitler wasn&#x2019;t content to rule over just Germany. He wanted to take over Europe. In 1939, he invaded Poland, starting World War II. In 1941, Japan&#x2014;an ally of Germany&#x2014;bombed a US naval base in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, bringing the United States into the war.<br> &nbsp;<br> World War II was devastating. More than fifty million people&#x2014;and perhaps as many as eighty million&#x2014;died. The Nazis murdered twelve million people, six million of them Jews.<br> &nbsp;<br> Berlin&#x2014;the seat of Nazi power&#x2014;was bombed heavily by US and British air forces during the war. On the ground, the Soviet Army marched toward Berlin. On April 30, 1945, knowing his war was lost, Hitler killed himself. When Germany surrendered on May 7, the Soviets held complete control over the crumbling capital.<br> &nbsp;<br> The war in Europe was over. Berlin was in ruins. The question now was: What would happen to Germany and its capital city?</p><h2>Bound by Honor (Born in Blood Mafia Chronicles)</h2><p>Born into one of the leading Mob families in Chicago, Aria Scuderi struggles to find her own path in a world where no choices are given.

Boxed facts and quotations from Lincoln himself are well set on the narrative pages, creating a layout that is engaging without being overwhelmingly busy. As with many nonfiction series books for the early-reader audience, the choice of vocabulary words that are defined in the appended glossary is sometimes curious, and some highly complex subjects, such as slavery, will need more discussion. Overall, though, the content and the presentation, including a brief quiz at the end, offer a readily accessible entry to the world of biography. Age-appropriate digital add-ons (prizes for quiz completion and a QR code to a video) add to this title&#x2019;s appeal.

Belongs on every child's bookshelf.<br><br> &nbsp;</p><p>Scott Gustafson is the award-winning author and illustrator of Artisan&#x2019;s <i>Classic Fairy Tales, Favorite Nursery Rhymes from Mother Goose, </i>and <i>Classic Bedtime Stories</i>, as well as an illustrated novel for young readers entitled <i>Eddie: The Last Youth of Edgar Allen Poe</i> and many other illustrated children&#x2019;s books. He lives in Chicago with his wife and son.Gr. 3-5. Gustafson uses 10 familiar folktales as vehicles for more than 70 elaborately detailed paintings that he acknowledges owe much to N.C. Wyeth, Arthur Rackham, and Normal Rockwell. The tales in the oversize volume are presented in toned down, nonviolent versions; the princess kisses the frog prince rather than throwing him against a wall, for instance, and "Cinderella" ends amicably. "The Three Pigs" is the most altered; as neither of the first two pigs dies, and some of the dialogue is rhymed ("'Ha, ha, old wolf, for a fool you've been taken. That butter churn was full of bacon!'"). The illustrations, ranging from thumb-size vignettes to full-spread scenes, feature nearly photo-realistic figures clad in sumptuous court dress and posed with broadly emotive body language. Gustafson's art doesn't measure up to that of Paul Zelinsky or K. Y. Craft for intensity of feeling, but it does lack Michael Hague's occasionally overwrought sentimentality, and there's plenty to see in the easy-on-the-eyes views. <i>John Peters</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

But when he breaks free from his shackles and tears through the streets of Mousopolis, there's no stopping his terrifying rampage. Is <i>anyone</i> clever enough to halt this massive meowing menace? <br></p><p><i>"Considered one of the most popular contemporary authors for readers in elementary school, (Dav Pilkey) is also regarded as a talented artist and inventive humorist as well as a subtle moralist. ...He underscores his works--even at their most outrageous--with a philosophy that emphasizes friendship, tolerance, and generosity and celebrates the triumph of the good-hearted." </i><b></b><br><b>-The Educational Book &amp; Media Association</b><br><br>Dav Pilkey is the Caldecott Honor Award-winning creator of more than 40 books for children.In a bold departure for Pilkey ( When Cats Dream ), these two brazenly funny picture books spoof Godzilla and King Kong as they launch the mice inhabitants of Mousopolis against, respectively, a killer cat and dog. Touched-up photographs of the author's pets are set against fluorescent cityscapes and luminous skylines. The texts ripple with corny but kid-pleasing puns ("The Big Cheese tried to catch up to the hot dog with all the relish he could muster") and shameless gags (" 'What are you, men or mice?' 'Mice,' they squeaked"), while the pictures are packed with sly allusions (the mice give Kat Kong passage on the U.S.S. Ignatz ). Dogzilla is the more successful volume, for it works within its own simple framework--giant dog steals cookout food, mice win a playful revenge--and even delivers a surprise ending. The more hard-hearted Kat Kong jestingly raises serious issues (Does morality have a position in science?) without acknowledging their validity. Pilkey's irreverent exuberance is irresistible nonetheless. These inventive books may lack the elegance and soul of William Wegman's work, but they are infinitely more fun.

He is author of many books, including <em>A Guide to Rational Living</em> and <em>Reason and Emotion in Psychotherapy</em>.</p><p>&#x201c;For anyone in the prison of depression, this workbook might help you get out. It&#x2019;s both scholarly and practical, and leaves no stone unturned in laying out self-help strategies for helping deal with this widespread problem.&#x201d; <br> &#x2014;Frank Farley, PhD, L. H. Carnell Professor at Temple University in Philadelphia, PA, and former president of the American Psychological Association</p> <br><br> <p>&#x201c;William Knaus has been a leading practitioner and teacher of cognitive behavior therapy for over four decades. In <em>The Cognitive Behavioral Workbook for Depression</em>, he draws from his vast store of experience to provide people who struggle with depression practical, usable strategies they can put to immediate use to not only feel better, but to get better. Written in an engaging, accessible manner, the book is chock full of powerful tools that, when compiled into a personal action plan, can both defeat depression and build a happy, productive life. I think this is a substantial book anyone, not just the depressive, will find valuable, and I highly endorse it for both the lay public and the clinical community alike. I know that I will keep it handy for my own personal reference and repeatedly encourage my clients to purchase it.&#x201d; <br> &#x2014;Russell Grieger, PhD, clinical psychologist in private practice, organizational consultant, and adjunct professor at The University of Virginia</p> <br><br> <p>&#x201c;I have waited for this book my entire career! With compassion, flexibility, and scientifically sound earnestness, Knaus helps the depressed reader navigate the wide variety of cognitive behavioral treatments to choose the package that is right for him or her. Second editions often contain few, if any, theoretical concepts and clinical exercises that are significantly different from those in the first edition. Not so with this volume! It is full of fresh ideas and therapeutic assignments that help the motivated depressed individual finally crawl out of self-defeating misery.&#x201d; <br> &#x2014;Barry Lubetkin, PhD, ABPP, founder and director of the Institute for Behavior Therapy in New York, NY</p> <br><br> <p>&#x201c;There are many self-help books on the market, but many are somewhere between vague and incomprehensible. Not this one. Knaus is a true teacher in the mold of Socrates, an instructor who takes you by the hand and leads you step-by-step to a successful outcome. Depression has become virtually viral during the last few years, and this is a book that promises to relieve the distress and delivers on its promise. And you don&#x2019;t need an advanced degree in psychology to understand the Knaus message. Anyone who can follow the plans to build a model airplane or follow recipe directions can use this book to conquer depression. It is so readable that you&#x2019;ll think Knaus is standing beside you. Without question, he is the country&#x2019;s leading expert on the cognitive-behavioral approach.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Richard C. Sprinthall, PhD, professor emeritus at American International College and licensed clinical psychologist</p> <br><br> <p>&#x201c;Occasionally a book on depression comes around that is different from the usual dull books on this topic. This is one of those outstanding books. Between its covers, you&#x2019;ll discover a helpful and balanced approach. The ideas can quickly grab your attention, peak your interest, and titillate your sense of humor. I finished this book smiling, feeling lighter, and being better able to help those suffering from depression.&#x201d; <br> &#x2014;Rev. Thomas A. Downes, PhD, master chaplain at the Academy of Certified Chaplains, REBT supervisor, and cofounder of the Order of Universal Interfaith</p> <br><br> <p>&#x201c;Depression impacts the lives of millions; as many as twenty percent of the world population is affected over a lifetime. A leading cause of disability, depression is a highly serious but largely untreated condition. Knaus presents an up-to-date, evidence-based cognitive behavioral approach that practically anyone can use to defeat and prevent depression. This is probably the best psychological self-help manual on the subject. Besides being immensely beneficial to anyone who reads it, I predict this work will help reduce a lot of suffering in this world. Outstanding!&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Sanjay Singh, MD, DNB, PhD, rational emotive education (REE) representative in India</p> <br><br> <p>&#x201c;Knaus has admirably culled the best treatments for depression from the field of cognitive behavioral therapy and integrated them into a highly readable and useful program of self-help. Although the seminal work of Albert Ellis informs the approach, many other contributions to the understanding of depression are seamlessly included. Everyone who wants to know more about clinical depression and its proven treatments can benefit from this comprehensive account.&#x201d; <br> &#x2014;Richard L. Wessler, PhD, emeritus professor of psychology in New York, NY, and developer of cognitive appraisal therapy</p> <br><br> <p>&#x201c;Knaus has written much more than a workbook. This is an uncommonly excellent guide for students, mental health practitioners, and those suffering from depression. He takes complex cognitive behavioral theory and makes it readily understandable. Moreover, by copious use of charts, diagrams, graphics, and questionnaires, he shows how this treatment for depression can be readily applied. This workbook is a self-help pearl as well as a psychotherapeutic gem.&#x201d; <br> &#x2014;V. Rev. Fr. George Morelli, PhD, licensed clinical psychologist, marriage and family therapist, and chairman of the department of chaplain and pastoral counseling of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese</p> <br><br> <p>&#x201c;In this second edition of <em>The Cognitive Behavioral Workbook for Depression</em>, Knaus eloquently and compassionately converts a three-pronged truth about depression&#x2014;that it is a time-limited state of mind that can be remedied through activity&#x2014;into a set of incredibly powerful cognitive behavioral tools for defeating depression. Helping you to identify and refute irrational thoughts that may be keeping you depressed, Knaus gently guides you to take action. Read this book, do the exercises, and don&#x2019;t just find out how to conquer your depression&#x2014;actually do it! <br> &#x2014;Elliot D. Cohen, PhD, author of <em>The Dutiful Worrier</em></p> <br><br> <p>&#x201c;Knaus has again produced a handbook that is filled with useful ideas and practical exercises to help people overcome a wide variety of challenges. He takes a simple approach with explanations and examples that give people confidence that they can get started without great difficulty. The handbook includes lots of ways to track progress and document the results of exercises, and employs a graduated approach by beginning with simple, less challenging exercises and progressively building to much more challenging issues. Knaus&#x2019; book should prove very helpful to anyone wanting to improve their handling of many of life&#x2019;s challenges.&#x201d; <br> &#x2014;James W.

Why am I here? What is wrong with the world? </em>and <em>How can what is wrong be made right? </em>While we may not say them, it is in the soul of every person to wrestle with these questions.</p><p> </p><p>Allow me to answer these questions first from the perspective of our culture and then from the perspective of the Bible.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>ANSWERS FROM OUR CULTURE</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> <em>Who am I? </em></strong>You are an accident. You are a mistake. You are a glorified ape. You are the result of random evolutionary process. That's it. No rhyme. No reason. No purpose. This is the pathetic reality when evolution runs its full course. If the idea is carried to its logical conclusion, human beings have no value. You are ultimately nothing.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Why am I here?</em> </strong>You are here to consume and enjoy. That's the only thing that matters. When the famous philanthropist John D. Rockefeller was asked, "How much money is enough?" he was as honest as any man has ever been. He responded, "Just a little bit more." Consume and enjoy--that's why you're here.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong><em>What is wrong with the world? </em></strong>People are either insufficiently educated or insufficiently governed. That's what's wrong with the world. People either don't know enough, or they're not being watched enough.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong><em>How can what is wrong be made right?</em></strong></p><p>The solution is more education and more government. Teach people more stuff and give them more information. How do we combat AIDS? Through AIDS awareness. How do we combat racism? Anti-hate classes. What about the man who beats his wife? Anger-management classes. Just give people more information and everything will be fine.</p><p> </p><p>The answers provided by our culture leave us wanting and empty. Let's now take a look at how God's Word, the Bible, answers these same questions.</p><p> </p><p><strong>ANSWERS FROM THE BIBLE</strong></p><p><strong><em> </em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Who am I? </em></strong>You cannot figure out who<em> you </em>are until you first discover who <em>Jesus Christ </em>is. Jesus "is the image of the invisible God....<em> by him all things were created</em>...all things were created through him and for him" (Colossians 1:15-16). He is the exact representation of God. He is the picture of God in human flesh. He is God on this earth. He is God with us, God among us. <strong><em></em></strong></p><p>The Bible says that I am created by God--in his image and likeness (Genesis 1:26). Not the result of random processes. The Bible says that whether I am tall and beautiful or small and not so handsome, whether my body functions perfectly or is severely deformed, I am the crowning glory of the creation of God, and as a result I have inherent dignity, worth, and value.</p><p><strong><em> </em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Why am I here? </em></strong>"All things were created through him <em>and for him</em>.... that <em>in everything he might be preeminent</em>" (Colossians 1:16b-18).<strong><em> </em></strong>The ultimate purpose of all things is to bring glory and honor to Jesus Christ. That's why I exist. That is why you exist. And because of this, contrary to the view of our culture, the reason for my existence goes far beyond consumption and enjoyment. <strong><em></em></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong><em>What is wrong with the world?</em></strong></p><p>I am. You are. Despite the fact that we are the crowning glory of the creation of God, created to live and bring glory and honor to the Lord Jesus Christ, we are instead hostile and disobedient toward the One by whom and for whom we were created. "All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned--every one--to his own way" (Isaiah 53:6). The Bible calls this disobedience towards God "sin", and it says that "all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23). In short, sin is what's wrong with the world.</p><p><em> </em></p><p><strong><em>How can what is wrong be made right?</em> </strong> What is wrong can only be made right by the substitutionary, atoning death of Christ. "He [Jesus] has now reconciled you in his body of flesh by his death, in order to present you holy and blameless and beyond reproach before him" (Colossians 1:22). There is <strong>no other means</strong> by which we can be made right with God. "There is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved" (Acts 4:12). </p><p>The Bible says, "For our sake [God] made him [Jesus} to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God" (2 Corinthians 5:21). There was nothing else that could have been done that would have allowed God to be righteous and also the one who makes us right. In the mercy of God the Father he punished his Son in our place in order to satisfy his righteous wrath against sin. Our only hope is to believe in Jesus who was crucified for us and rose again (1 Corinthians 1:23, 15:3-4). The sinless Lamb of God gave his life to pay a debt that he did not owe on behalf of sinners <em>who could never pay him back!</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>The Ultimate Answer</strong></p><p>If these two sets of answers--from our culture and from the Bible--are placed side by side, something very interesting happens. With the answers from our culture, you are left worthless, empty, and hopeless. You're on your own to pursue satisfaction...and you'll never find it. But the Bible says you are precious. You have purpose. You were purchased. </p><p>The only way what is wrong in your life can be made right is for you to believe what the Bible says. Believe that Jesus took the punishment for your sins by dying on the cross as a substitute for you and that he rose from the dead three days later, showing that God had accepted his death on the cross as the payment for the sin-debt that you owed to God. If you believe this to be true, repent of (completely turn from) your sinful patterns of life, and place your faith completely in Jesus Christ. God promises "if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved" (Romans 10:9).</p><p>The Answer to life's ultimate questions is Christ. Those who walk aimlessly through this life will never be satisfied with the answers our culture gives. Christ is the only one who will ever satisfy. Have you entrusted your life to him?</p><p> </p><p><strong> </strong></p></p><p><p><strong>Voddie Baucham Jr.</strong> (DMin, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary) is dean of the seminary at African Christian University in Lusaka, Zambia.

Despite a series of mishaps, he is one Lucky Dog!</p></p><p><p><strong>Ellen Fischer </strong>was born in St. Louis. Following graduation from Washington University, she taught children with special needs and then ESL at a Jewish Day School. She lives in Greensboro, North Carolina with her husband. They have three children.</p><p>"<strong>Do we need another juvenile Hanukkah book? The answer is definitively yes, in the case of this lovely new dog-centric book which gives a unique perspective on the holiday.</strong> An adorable newly adopted puppy has been res�cued from an animal shelter on the first night of Hanukkah and joins all his new family's celebrations. Latke manages to continuously behave somewhat inappropriately, thinking the delicious treats on the table and counter are for him, and the presents are his to unwrap. Fortunately, despite this, he is treated with lots of affection by his new family. Hoping he won't be sent back to the animal shelter, he tries to improve his behavior. <br> <br> Many symbols of the holiday appear in the colorful and age-appropriate illustrations: donuts, menorah, gifts wrapped in Jewish star wrapping paper, latkes, dreidels, applesauce, candles, and chocolate money abound. The illustrator loves to draw foxes and dogs, and she conveys warm feelings toward the sensitive pet. The Hebrew <em>sufganiyot</em> is used to describe donuts and the Yiddish words <em>gelt</em> and <em>latkes</em> also appear. On the page following the story there is a paragraph detailing the history and customs of Hanukkah. <br> <br> This sweet holiday story, told with humor, is perfect for the youngest listener through beginning reader." -- <em>Jewish Book World</em></p> (<i>Magazine</i>)<br><br><p>"A family rescues a golden brown dog from the animal shelter and names it Latke in honor of the beginning of Hanukkah. Each successive night, he gets in a bit of trouble, eating a platter of <em>sufganiyot </em>(fried donuts), tearing open presents, chewing up candles, and drooling on the Hanukkah gelt, and each night the family gets a little mad and then forgives him. A new pet is a growing experience for both the family and the pup, and the narration focuses on Latke's gratitude for being taken in ('I am one lucky dog!'), even as he hopes not to lose the family's affection while learning to function in their home. He is adorable, fluffy, and expressive, and Beeke's sunny palette and childlike illustrative style keep things light. <strong>This is a pleasant Hanukkah title, with the bonus of nicely conveying that the rescued animal is a lucky dog indeed. A brief description of the holiday is included.</strong>" &#x2015;<em>School Library Journal</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"<strong>Youngsters will root for the puppy</strong> who is adopted by a family as a Hanukkah present for their children. Hijinks ensue and the family is very tolerant as the young dog learns proper behavior. They name him Latke because his coloring is like a potato pancake. As the family lights each candle in the menorah, Latke seems to get into a jam. There is a note at the back of the book explaining the holiday of Hanukkah and unfamiliar terms. <strong>Child-like illustrations perfectly match the text.</strong> A cooking tie-in to the book would be appropriate. <strong>It is recommended for those libraries that need to round out their holiday book choices.</strong> [Editor's Note: Available in e-book format and paperback.] Recommended."&#x2015;<em>Library Media Connection</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Latke, a playful golden brown shelter dog with good intentions, comes to live with his new family on the first night of Hanukkah. However, he scoffs at the <em>sufganiyot</em> (jelly donuts), shreds the present wrappings, gobbles the latkes, gnaws on a dreidel, topples the applesauce, slobbers on the chocolate Hanukkah coins, and chomps the menorah candles into a sticky mess. Discouraged, the family begins to question their decision to adopt, until the final night of Hanukkah when they present him with his very own chew toy. Fischer's humorous story is narrated from Latke's perspective, effectively contrasting his well-meant exuberance with the family's growing distress. The kids are mostly understanding; Mom and Dad, not so much. Beeke's colorful artwork depicts everyone's efforts to do the right thing, while small touches (such as the candles in the menorah) convey holiday details. The story's secular tone will please less observant families. Pair with Jane Yolen's <em>How Do Dinosaurs Say Happy Chanukah </em>(2012) for another guide to proper holiday behavior." -- <em>Booklist Online</em></p> (<i>Website</i>)<br><br><p>"On the first night of Hanukkah, a family adopts a little golden-brown dog and names it Latke. As the family celebrates the Festival of Lights, Latke joins in, thinking, 'I am one lucky dog!' But he has a lot to learn about how to behave. This engaging romp follows Latke as he chews his way through the eight nights of Hanukkah. <strong>Told in Latke's voice, the story highlights the holiday's traditions as well as the love between the dog and his new family. Cheerful textured illustrations capture all of Latke's mischief.</strong>" &#x2015;starred, <em>The Horn Book Magazine</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)</p><h2>Baby Sees Colors: A totally mesmerizing high-contrast book for babies</h2><p><b>Newborn babies as young as six weeks old</b> will be mesmerized by the <b>bold shapes and colors</b> in BABY SEES COLORS!

Her first attempt published in 2003 featured black, white and red art, and found a loyal audience. But she was not satisfied:&nbsp;she refined the content as more and more babies read and responded to the art. She tried lines of different thickness, and eventually added more colors, and then in 2009, she stumbled onto a simple squiggle with a smiley face created by Akio Kashiwara, that changed everything. That squiggle was exactly what she was looking for. Ms. Sakagashi confimed her suspicion that babies would fall in love with Mr. Akio Kashiwara's art, and this book has sold close to 700,000 copies in Japan over the last 8 years, making lots of babies (and their parents) very happy.</p><h2>Practice Makes Perfect: Basic English, Premium Third Edition</h2><p><b>Get the skills you need to read and speak English with confidence!</b><br>Learn how to read and speak English with this easy-to-use workbook.

The last two spreads focus on the gator, who opens his jaws for one last fish&#x2014;and burps up all the birds, beasts, and bugs he&#x2019;s swallowed. The story, reminiscent of the Danish folktale The Fat Cat, unfolds in pleasing rhymes with a memorable chorus, while the appealing ink-and-watercolor illustrations offer their own interactive elements, from smooth, furry, fuzzy, feathery, shiny, and sticky textures, to a pull-tab chomping alligator jaw and a sturdy pop-up that expands the last spread.

For thousands of years, humans believed that Earth was at the center of the Universe, but all of that changed in the 17th century. Astronomers like Nicolaus Copernicus, Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, and Isaac Newton proposed the unthinkable theory that Earth and the other planets actually revolved around the Sun. This engaging book chronicles the beginning of the modern age of astronomy, then follows later discoveries, including NASA's current missions in space.</p><p>Stephanie Sabol is a native of the Jersey Shore and a graduate of Boston College. She currently resides in Hoboken, New Jersey.<b>Where Is Our Solar System?</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Thousands of years ago in China, farmers were out in the field working. It had been a sunny day. But suddenly the sky began to darken. This wasn&#x2019;t just a cloud&#x2014;the sun was disappearing! In a few minutes, the sky was completely dark. The farmers thought they knew what was happening. A dragon was eating the sun.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Quickly, they started to make noise. They chanted songs, beat drums, and banged pots and pans. They had to scare the dragon away. Then the sun would come back. Sure enough, in just a few minutes, it did. Making noise had worked, the farmers believed.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Today we know that a dragon wasn&#x2019;t trying to eat the sun. What those farmers in China saw was a total solar eclipse.<br> &nbsp;<br> Every year and a half or so, the moon, which is always circling Earth, will get in between the sun and Earth. For a few minutes the moon blocks the sun completely. There is no sunlight.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> However, in ancient times, the Chinese and other people didn&#x2019;t know the scientific reasons why certain events happened in the natural world. So they made up myths, or stories, to explain them.<br> &nbsp;<br> The ancient Greeks believed that a group of superhuman gods and goddesses ruled the world. Each morning, one of the gods, Helios, drove a chariot up in the sky, pulling the sun behind him. This was the sunrise. In the evening, he drove back down again. That was the sunset.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Mayans told stories about the moon. There was a moon goddess who fought with the sun, forcing it to go down into the underworld every night. That explained why the sun disappeared whenever the moon came out.<br> &nbsp;<br> Because of astronomy&#x2014;the scientific study of objects in space&#x2014;we know there are no gods or dragons ruling over the heavens. We know that the sun is a star&#x2014;a star made of hot gas. Eight planets circle, or &#x201c;orbit,&#x201d; around it, along with comets and asteroids. This is what we call our solar system. And even though we have learned much about it, there are still many things we have yet to discover. The solar system is still a big, exciting mystery.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 1:&nbsp;Sky Watching</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Although ancient people didn&#x2019;t understand why many things happened in their world, they were able to learn a lot just by observation. By looking. For instance, from watching the night sky, sailors realized that the position of stars acted like points on a map and helped them navigate their ships.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> During the day, the changing position of the sun told the time. Hunters knew to move to new areas when the seasons changed. And farmers saw that certain crops grew better if they were planted during a certain phase of the moon.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Ancient people also noticed that while some stars seemed to stay fixed in the sky, others moved about. Early Greek stargazers gave these &#x201c;stars&#x201d; a special name: <i>planetes</i>, which means &#x201c;wanderer.&#x201d; (It&#x2019;s where we get the word <i>planet</i>.) They were able to see five planets with the naked eye&#x2014;Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.<br> &nbsp;<br> Eventually, scientists in ancient Greece became more curious about the science behind the sun, moon, and planets. They wanted to understand <i>why </i>the planets moved, and why the moon seemed to change shape.<br> &nbsp;<br> This led to the beginning of the science of astronomy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Aristotle was born in Greece about 2,400 years ago. He was a brilliant philosopher and teacher. A philosopher studies different ideas about the meaning of life and the natural world. Aristotle, who tutored the famous king Alexander the Great, was also an astronomer.<br> &nbsp;<br> Aristotle realized that the Earth was round. Up until then, people believed the Earth was flat. They thought that if they walked to its edge, they would fall right off. Aristotle proved that the Earth was actually a sphere. How did he know this? He observed that some stars could only be seen from certain places on Earth. If you traveled far away (say from Greece to southern Africa), the stars would no longer be visible. The only explanation for this was that the Earth was curved and made certain stars disappear from view.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Greek scientist Ptolemy was born almost five hundred years after Aristotle, around AD 100. He lived and worked in Alexandria, Egypt. From watching how the other planets moved, Ptolemy thought that the Earth was the center of the universe. He thought that the other planets and the sun rotated around Earth. He was not correct, but people kept on believing Ptolemy for another 1,400 years!<br> &nbsp;<br> During the Middle Ages, astronomy flourished in the Islamic empire that spread over much of the Middle East, North Africa, and Spain. One of the most famous Islamic astronomers was Omar Khayyam. Khayyam was born in 1048. He built an observatory in what is now Iran. (An observatory is a building with scientific equipment to study the sky.) From watching the movements of the planets, Khayyam made a calendar. It was so accurate that it is still used in Iran and Afghanistan today.<br> &nbsp;<br> So, little by little, information became known about the solar system. However, truly amazing discoveries in astronomy didn&#x2019;t come for another four hundred years.</p><h2>Old-Time Valentine Stickers: 23 Full Color Pressure-Sensitive Designs (Dover Stickers)</h2><p>Engaging designs reproduced from rare sources include cupids, adorable children, romantic messages, more.

When one of the brothers dies tragically, Dominic accompanies the other two to America and discovers that the boys may actually be related to him in more than just spirit. He arrives on Ellis Island, first as a new immigrant, and finally as a boy returning from a long journey, or perhaps a dream, that has given him a new sense of himself as well as hope for his future. Easy to read and hard to put down, this convincing novel gives a poignant and believable picture of the lives and motivations of some of this country's immigrants, and of one boy who learns about himself. While the time-travel element and subsequent plot twists occur almost too easily, the characters and situations are too involving to quibble about story construction. An enjoyable and informative tale.?Susan L.

And satisfier? By studying and serving his wife so he can fulfill her needs, just as Christ humbled Himself for our sakes.</p><p>First published in 2002 as <i>Tony Evans Speaks Out on a Man&#x2019;s Role in the Home</i>, this booklet has sold nearly 40,000 copies.

With an introduction by Stephen King. <br></b><br>Death is reporter Jack McEvoy's beat: his calling, his obsession. But this time, death brings McEvoy the story he never wanted to write--and the mystery he desperately needs to solve. A serial killer of unprecedented savagery and cunning is at large. His targets: homicide cops, each haunted by a murder case he couldn't crack. The killer's calling card: a quotation from the works of Edgar Allan Poe. His latest victim is McEvoy's own brother. And his last...may be McEvoy himself.<br><strong><br></strong> <br><br></p><p>Jack McEvoy is a Denver crime reporter with the stickiest assignment of his career. His twin brother, homicide detective Sean McEvoy, was found dead in his car from a self-inflicted bullet wound to the head--an Edgar Allen Poe quote smeared on the windshield. Jack is going to write the story. The problem is that Jack doesn't believe that his brother killed himself, and the more information he uncovers, the more it looks like Sean's death was the work of a serial killer. Jack's research turns up similar cases in cities across the country, and within days, he's sucked into an intense FBI investigation of an Internet pedophile who may also be a cop killer nicknamed the Poet. It's only a matter of time before the Poet kills again, and as Jack and the FBI team struggle to stay ahead of him, the killer moves in, dangerously close.<p> In a break from his Harry Bosch novels--including <i>The Concrete Blonde</i> and <i>The Last Coyote</i>--Edgar-winning novelist Michael Connelly creates a new hero who is a lot greener but no less believable. <i>The Poet</i> will keep readers holding their breath until the very end: the characters are multilayered, the plot compelling, and the denouement a true surprise. Connelly fans will not be disappointed. <i>--Mara Friedman</i></p>Jack McEvoy specializes in death. As a crime reporter for the Rocky Mountain News, he has seen every kind of murder. But his professional bravado doesn&#39;t lessen the brutal shock of learning that his only brother is dead, a suicide. Jack&#39;s brother was a homicide detective, and he had been depressed about a recent murder case, a hideously grisly one, that he&#39;d been unable to solve. McEvoy decides that the best way to exorcise his grief is by writing a feature on police suicides. But when he begins his research, he quickly arrives at a stunning revelation. Following his leads, protecting his sources, muscling his way inside a federal investigation, Jack grabs hold of what is clearly the story of a lifetime. He also knows that in taking on the story, he&#39;s making himself the most visible target for a murderer who has eluded the greatest investigators alive.</p><h2>NKJV, Study Bible for Kids, Softcover, Multicolor: The Premier NKJV Study Bible for Kids</h2><p><p><strong>This is the premier New King James Version study Bible for children. </strong><strong>It is targeted for kids 8 to 12, and it&#x2019;s in full color!

Jon went to school at Culver Military Academy in Indiana where he was a Lieutenant; Albion College in Michigan where he studied to be a doctor; and Columbia University in New York, where he received an M.F.A. in fiction. He taught elementary school in New York for ten years in a variety of positions. He is the author of many books for children including the&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;Best Illustrated Book&nbsp;The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales&nbsp;(illustrated by Lane Smith), the Caldecott Honor book&nbsp;The True Story of the Three Little Pigs&nbsp;(illustrated by Lane Smith), and&nbsp;Math Curse&nbsp;(illustrated by Lane Smith). &nbsp;In addition to his work as an author, Jon also runs a web-based literacy program called &#x201c;Guys Read&#x201d; that is designed to encourage boys, particularly reluctant readers, to get involved with books. In 2008, Jon was named the country&#x2019;s first National Ambassador for Young People&#x2019;s Literature, a joint effort of the Library of Congress and the Children&#x2019;s Book Council. During his two-year role as Ambassador, he acted as a spokesperson for children&#x2019;s literature, speaking to groups of parents, teachers, and children to encourage the importance of reading. You can visit Jon online at www.jsworldwide.com.The author of the hilarious The True Story of the Three Little Pigs (1989) comes up with an entertaining formula in this first ``Time Warp Trio'' story: Narrator Joe is given a magic book (''The Book'') that transports him and two friends to King Arthur's Britain, where they find themselves confronted by a fearsome Black Knight--who's easy to defeat with some quick dodging when he's in mid-charge. Then Lancelot, Gawain, et al. happen by and take the boys for heroes--a reputation they sustain by tricking the loathsome giant who's menacing the castle into fighting the terrible dragon (Smaug) that has also just turned up. Scieszka unobtrusively slips in several classic references and defines some chivalric jargon by having the boys comically paraphrase it; there is some daring juvenile humor on the subject of the giant's various atrocious smells, and the contrast between the boys' breezy manner and the knights' pseudo-formality is also good for several laughs. A little forced, but this should serve its purpose. Smith's drawings deftly reflect the blend of everyday kid with zany, mock-gruesome adventure.

He lives and works in Narberth, Pennsylvania.PreS-Gr 2-Higgins's latest offering is a fun story of two bicycle enthusiasts who accidentally meet and develop a friendship. Maurice owns a lemonade stand on wheels, while Lotta rides around collecting sticks to distribute from the basket on her bike. When the two crash and are left to manage on foot, a crafty Sid intervenes and saves the day. The narrative is lyrical and charming, with "squeezy drops of sunshine" lemons and heartfelt adoration for the possibility found in twigs. OHora's acrylic illustrations are quirky, and the characters' expressions are endearing. The page layouts shift from full page to comic book-style panels, which in some cases could lead to a little confusion for newly independent readers and may make the title better as a one-on-one read rather than a larger group share for storytime. However, the tale's message, that sometimes things that were once new can quickly become familiar and comfortable, particularly when making friends, is solid encouragement for young readers. VERDICT A sweet story of friendship, full of musings about potential that can be inspiring to imaginative minds. This is a good read for those in search of some whimsy and warmth.-Kaitlin Malixi, Kensington Health Sciences Academy, Philadelphia&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

Lizzy is the author-illustrator of <em>Good Enough to Eat</em>; <em>The Busy Body Book</em>; and <em>Hello Baby!</em> Both Anne and Lizzy live in Connecticut. </p>Rockwell (illustrator of My Spring Robin; On Show and Tell Day) serves up a simple but often bland introduction to nutrition. Watercolor and colored-pencil illustrations offer close-up views of a variety of foods and introduce a cast of smiling, wide-eyed kids whose comments (presented in balloons) supplement the facts in the text. The compositions are cheerful and sometimes playful, as when a boy dressed in a skeleton costume delivers a message about the value of calcium in building and "repairing" bones. The palette, unfortunately, is muted or shadowy, so that the pictured foods never look very appetizing. The author discusses such basics as the importance of eating a balanced diet, the process of digestion, sources of various vitamins and minerals, etc. She concludes with a handful of nutritious, carefully written, kid-friendly recipes. The only other hands-on aspect of the volume is a vaguely outlined experiment "to find out where fat is hiding," which entails rubbing foods (no specific varieties are suggested) on a piece of paper and examining it for grease stains the following day. Given the book's targeted audience, Rockwell has perhaps gone too far in streamlining her information; those above the beginning-reader level may well find the tone of both the art and the text (with the exception of the recipes) somewhat babyish.

Two endearing siblings star in a witty story about the triumph of imagination over proclivity.</p><p>Lola is a very fussy eater. Carrots are for rabbits and peas are "too small and too green." One day, after rattling off her long list of despised foods, she ends with the vehement pronouncement, "And I absolutely will never not ever eat a tomato." Not convinced, Lola's older sister Charlie has an idea. She tells Lola that the orange things on the table are not carrots, but "orange twiglets from Jupiter" and peas are in fact "green drops from Greenland." Mashed potatoes, when pitched as "cloud fluff from the pointiest peak of Mount Fuji" suddenly seem appealing to Lola.

Although there are numerous books about starting school, Going to Day Care is one of the few titles which deals with day care. The text discusses both family day care and day-care centers and deals with activities that concern children, such as eating, sleeping and going to the bathroom. The second title serves as a starting point for parent and child discussions about The New Baby. Although the text deals with feelings of jealousy and envy, they are not the major focus, as they are in Martha Alexander's Nobody Asked Me If I Wanted a Baby Sister (Dial, 1971). The positive and negative aspects of a new baby in the house are presented in a manner easily understood by preschoolers, and are further clarified by the liberal use of color photographs. Questions are included as discussion starters, in a manner similar to the way Mister Rogers speaks on his television program. Two very fine titles about children's first experiences.

Her books include the Scaredy Squirrel, Chester and Learning With Animals series, Augustine, Leon the Chameleon and Have I Got a Book for You! She lives near Montreal.</p>PreSchool-Grade 3&#x2013;Scaredy Squirrel is lonely, but he thinks that the pleasure of making a friend would be outweighed by the greater risk of potential danger. After all, there are a lot of things that bite out in the big world beyond his tree trunk such as beavers, bunnies, and, of course, Godzilla. Always thinking, Scaredy decides that the perfect friend (as in perfectly safe, clean, and quiet) would be the goldfish he spots across the park. He carefully outlines everything he will need to do to introduce himself to it, including handing over the Scaredy Risk Test to insure that his new friend is truly not a biter. What the squirrel doesn't plan for is the muddy, rowdy dog he encounters en route. However, he learns that friends come in all sorts of packages and that making an effort can really have rewards. The life lessons of the importance of overcoming one's fears and not judging on outward appearance are wrapped up in a witty package of deceptively simple cartoonlike illustrations that deliver great humor in a variety of lists and diagrams, such as the items Scaredy will need to make the perfect friend, how to outfit himself to make the perfect first impression, and an especially funny Perfect Plan map. The ebullient artwork, clever layout, and lively text make for a surefire hit.&#x2013;<i>Susan Moorhead, New Rochelle Public Library, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

There had to be something to complain about. This was New Year&#x2019;s Eve in Los Angeles, one of the most annoying nights of the year in arguably the most annoying city known to humanity. So why couldn&#x2019;t she think of a thing?<br> <br>She sipped her skinny margarita from her chaise and watched her husband&#x2019;s beautiful body cut through the water like a moving art installation. When Miles emerged, he propped himself on the back of the lit infinity pool, where the turquoise water appeared to spill over the side and straight down the mountain. Behind him, the lights from the valley twinkled for miles, making the city look alluring, even sexy. Night was the only time Los Angeles really shone. Gone were the smog and the junkies and the soul-crushing traffic, all replaced by an idyllic vista of night sky and silently twinkling lights&#x2014;as if God Himself had descended into the Hollywood Hills and selected the most perfect Snapchat filter for His least favorite city on earth.<br> <br>Miles smiled at her and she waved, but when he motioned for her to join him, she shook her head. It was unseasonably warm, and all around her, people were partying in that intensely determined way that happened only on New Year&#x2019;s Eve after midnight: This will be the most fun we&#x2019;ve ever had; we will do and say outrageous things; we are loving our lives and everyone around us. The massive hot tub was packed with a dozen revelers, all with drinks in hand, and another group sat around the perimeter, content to dangle their feet while they waited for a few inches of space to free up. On the deck above the pool a DJ blasted remixed hip-hop, and dancers everywhere&#x2014;on the patio, in the pool, on the pool deck, streaming in and out of the house&#x2014;all moved happily to his playlist. On the chair to Emily&#x2019;s left, a young girl wearing only bikini bottoms straddled a guy and massaged his shoulders while her bare breasts dangled freely. She worked her way down his back and began a rather aggressive handling of his glutes. She was twenty-three, twenty-five at most, and while her body was far from perfect&#x2014;slightly rounded belly and overly curvy thighs&#x2014;her arms didn&#x2019;t jiggle and her neck didn&#x2019;t sag. No crepey anything. Just youth. None of the small indignities of Emily&#x2019;s own body at thirty-six: light stretch marks on her hips; cleavage with just the smallest hint of sag; some errant dark hairs along her bikini line that just seemed to sprout now willy-nilly, indifferent to Emily&#x2019;s indefatigable waxing schedule. It wasn&#x2019;t a horror show, exactly&#x2014;she still looked thin and tan, maybe even downright hot in her elegant Eres two-piece&#x2014;but it was getting harder with every passing year.<br> <br>An unfamiliar 917 number flashed on her phone.<br> <br>&#x201c;Emily? This is Helene. I&#x2019;m not sure if you remember, but we met a couple years ago at the Met Ball.&#x201d;<br> <br>Emily looked skyward in concentration. Though the name was familiar, she was having a hard time placing it. Silence filled the air.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Rizzo&#x2019;s manager.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rizzo. Interesting. He was the new Bieber: the hottest pop star whose fame had skyrocketed when, two years earlier at age sixteen, he&#x2019;d become the youngest male to win a Grammy for Album of the Year. Helene had moved to Hollywood to join an agency&#x2014;either ICM or Endeavor, Emily couldn&#x2019;t remember&#x2014;but she&#x2019;d somehow missed the news that Helene now represented Rizzo.<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course. How are you?&#x201d; Emily asked. She glanced at her watch. This was no ordinary call.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry I&#x2019;m calling so late,&#x201d; Helene said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s already four a.m. here in New York, but you&#x2019;re probably in L.A. I feel terrible interrupting . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s fine. I&#x2019;m at Gigi Hadid&#x2019;s childhood mansion and not nearly as drunk as I should be. What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d;<br> <br>A shriek came from the pool. Two girls had jumped in together, holding hands, and were splashing Miles and a couple of his friends. Emily rolled her eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I, uh . . .&#x201d; Helene cleared her throat. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re off the record, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; This sounded promising.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure I understand the whole story myself, but Riz appeared on Seacrest&#x2019;s Times Square show earlier tonight&#x2014;everything was fine, it went off without a hitch. Afterward, I went to meet up with some old college friends, and Rizzo was headed to some party at 1 OAK. Sober, at least when he left me. Happy about his performance.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And just this second I got texted a picture from a colleague who works in ICM&#x2019;s New York office and happens to be at 1 OAK right now . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And it&#x2019;s not good.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What? Is he passed out? Covered in his own puke? Kissing a guy? Doing lines? Groping an underage girl?&#x201d;<br> <br>Helene sighed and began to speak, but she was drowned out by shrieking laughter. In the shallow end, a girl with hot pink hair and a thong bikini had found her way atop Miles&#x2019;s shoulders for an improvised chicken fight.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry, can you repeat that? It&#x2019;s a little chaotic here,&#x201d; Emily said as she watched the tiny piece of suit fabric wedge even tighter between the girl&#x2019;s naked ass cheeks, themselves spread straight across the back of Emily&#x2019;s husband&#x2019;s neck.<br> <br>&#x201c;He appears to be wearing a Nazi costume.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Like with a swastika armband and a coordinating headband. Storm trooper boots. The whole nine.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, Jesus Christ,&#x201d; Emily muttered without thinking.<br> <br>&#x201c;That bad?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s not great. Prince Harry pulled that stunt forever ago&#x2014;but we have to work with what we have. I&#x2019;m not going to lie, I would&#x2019;ve preferred drugs or boys.&#x201d;<br> <br>In the pool, the pink-haired girl on Miles&#x2019;s shoulders reached behind her back, yanked the tie of her bikini top, and began swinging the top around her head like a lasso.<br> <br>&#x201c;First things first: who knows?&#x201d; Emily asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing has shown up online yet, but of course, it&#x2019;s only a matter of time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just so we&#x2019;re clear: you&#x2019;re calling to hire me, yes?&#x201d; Emily asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. Definitely.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, then right now I want you to text your colleague and have him get Rizzo into the men&#x2019;s room and out of that getup. I don&#x2019;t care if he&#x2019;s wearing a gold lam� banana hammock, it&#x2019;s better than the Nazi thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I already did that. He gave Riz his button-down and shoes, confiscated the armband, and let him keep the trousers, which apparently are bright red. It&#x2019;s not perfect, but it&#x2019;s the best we can do, especially since I can&#x2019;t reach Rizzo directly. But someone will post something any second, I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Agreed, so listen up. Here&#x2019;s the plan. You&#x2019;re going to jump in a cab and head over to 1 OAK and forcibly remove him. Bring a girl or two, it&#x2019;ll look better, and then get him back to his apartment and don&#x2019;t let him leave. Sit in front of the damn door if you have to. Do you have his passwords? Actually, forget it&#x2014;just take his phone. Drop it in the toilet. We need to buy ourselves time without some idiotic drunken tweet from him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay. Will do.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The first flight out of here is six a.m. I&#x2019;m going home to pack, and then I&#x2019;ll head to the airport. The story will definitely break while I&#x2019;m in the air, if not before. Do not&#x2014;I repeat, do not&#x2014;make a statement. Do not let him talk to anyone, not even the delivery guy who brings up the food. Information lockdown, you understand? No matter how bad the photos are, or how horrified the reaction&#x2014;and trust me, it&#x2019;s going to be bad&#x2014;I want no response until I get there, okay?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you, Emily. I&#x2019;m going to owe you for this one.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Go now!&#x201d; Emily said, managing not to utter what she was actually thinking&#x2014;namely, that the charge for her time and the holiday and the travel was going to take Helene&#x2019;s breath away.<br> <br>She took the last sip of her margarita, set the drink on the glass table next to her, and stood up, trying to ignore the couple beside her who may or may not have been having actual intercourse.<br> <br>&#x201c;Miles? Honey?&#x201d; Emily called as politely as she could manage.<br> <br>No response.<br> <br>&#x201c;Miles, love? Can you please move her thighs away from your ears for thirty seconds? I have to leave.&#x201d;<br> <br>She was pleased to see her husband unceremoniously lower the girl into the water and swim over to the side. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not mad, are you? She&#x2019;s just some dumb kid.&#x201d;<br> <br>Emily knelt. &#x201c;Of course I&#x2019;m not mad. If you&#x2019;re going to cheat, you better pick someone a hell of a lot hotter than that.&#x201d; She nodded toward the girl, who looked not at all pleased with her wet hair. &#x201c;I got a call from New York. It&#x2019;s an emergency with Rizzo. I&#x2019;m running home to get a bag and hopefully get to LAX for the six a.m. I&#x2019;ll call you when I land, okay?&#x201d;<br> <br>This was hardly the first time Emily had been called away in the middle of something&#x2014;her surgeon girlfriend claimed Emily had worse call hours than she did&#x2014;but Miles looked positively stupefied.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s New Year&#x2019;s Eve. Isn&#x2019;t there anyone in New York who can handle this?&#x201d; His unhappiness was obvious, and Emily felt a pang, but she tried to keep it light.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry, love. Can&#x2019;t say no to this one. Stay, have fun. Not too much fun . . .&#x201d; She added the last part to make him feel better&#x2014;she wasn&#x2019;t one iota concerned about Miles doing anything stupid. She bent down and pecked his wet lips. &#x201c;Call you later,&#x201d; she said, and wove through the throngs to the circular driveway, where one of the cute valets motioned for a Town Car to pull around. He held the door for her, and she flashed him a smile and a ten-dollar bill.<br> <br>&#x201c;Two stops, please,&#x201d; she said to the driver. &#x201c;First one is on Santa Monica Boulevard, where you&#x2019;ll wait for me. Then to the airport. And fast.&#x201d;<br> <br>New York, her first and truest love, awaited.</p><h2>ESV Holy Bible for Kids</h2><p><p>The&nbsp;<em>ESV Holy Bible for Kids</em>&nbsp;is a highly affordable Bible made just for kids.

Tom is a longtime freelance writer who has written nine cop novels. He lives in New York. Mike Philbin is a musician and lives in New Hampshire.<p><b>Excerpt from Chapter 1: Meet the Serial Killer</b></p> <p>Serial killers are a lot different from regular murderers. Most people who commit murder do so out of passion and anger. When homicide cops investigate, they usually look at family members as suspects first. There are, of course, people who plan a murder for financial or other gain, but murder is most often a crime of passion. Serial killers are much different; they kill many people, almost all of whom are usually strangers, over a period of time, and usually with some sort of cooling-off period between killings.</p> <p>According to the FBI, a serial killer is someone who has killed a minimum of three people. We agree that this generally is a true definition, but we would also put firmly into the serial killer category those killers who were stopped from murdering before they reached three victims because they were caught or otherwise incapacitated, but who, because of the way they committed their crimes, would have killed at least three - maybe many more.</p> <p>The Canadian Paul Bernardo and his masochistic lover Karla Homolka are prime examples of this: They killed three people, but as one of the murders was legally categorized as manslaughter, they aren't "official" serial killers because only two of their killings are considered first degree murder. But a close look at the murderous drive inside the two - a drive that facilitated the rape and murder of young girls, including Karla's younger sister - reveals that there was no way they would have stopped killing had they not been caught. (More on Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka in Chapter 25.)</p> <p><b>The Answer Is Found in Childhood</b><br> So, then, what creates a serial killer? Why this compulsion - and it is a compulsion - to kill multiple times?</p> <p>Some people think that the compulsion to kill may be the result of trauma to the brain. This is what the Tampa, Florida, serial killer Bobby Joe Long thought drove him to rape and murder women; he claimed that, before a motorcycle accident that caused severe head trauma, he never thought about killing women.</p> <p>Some psychiatrists think it's genetic, that an aberration of some sort occurs and puts people on a homicidal path. Another potential reason is that something dreadful happens to the human psyche when a child is shipped to an orphanage, or given up to a foster care system. Author John Bowlby says in his book The Making and Breaking of Affectional Bonds (1979), "In psychopaths the incidence of illegitimacy and the shunting of the child from one home to another is high. It is no accident that Ian Brady of the Moors murders was such a one."</p> <p>Most psychiatrists are usually vague about exactly what compels someone to kill people, and it's true that there is no definitive answer. However, most doctors believe that serial killers are programmed in their childhoods to be killers - and it's not just doctors who feel that way. Most investigators who are close to these crimes and criminals agree, people like the FBI's John Douglas and Robert Ressler, premier profilers and investigators who have been investigating serial killers since the term was coined in the 1970s.</p> <p>We believe that to understand the why of serial killers, one has to first accept the existence of the unconscious mind: that things are going on it constantly and that it is capable of controlling behavior. When a child is abused in one way or another by parents, the anger and terror he or she feels is hidden in the unconscious, which becomes like a seething cauldron, and the child starts looking for ways to deal with the terrifying feelings emerging from it. Someone in the family, usually the mother or father, has clearly shown the child that he or she has no value except perhaps as a sex object or someone to hurt. A terrible fear builds up in the child's unconscious that results from feeling constantly under threat, so the child starts to formulate fantasies of being all-powerful, controlling, and able to handle whatever comes his or her way. Then, the child creates symbolic scenarios in which he or she is dominant or acts out, first by showing mastery over animals by abusing them, and sometimes over structures while burning them down. This manifests in adulthood as a powerful sex drive and the abuse of the women or children in the person's life.</p> <p>While all of us are subject to some stress in our childhoods from our parents, the stress we are talking about here is horrendous, and the reaction of the child is equally so. Indeed, this book is full of horrendous things that happened to children who went on to become serial murderers: Ken Bianchi's mother, a prostitute, held his hand over a stove flame to punish him. Edmund Kemper's parents made him kill his pet chicken and forced him to eat it, tears streaming down his face, for dinner.</p> <p>At some point in serial killers' development - usually when they're in their twenties - the fantasies or the cruelty to animals is no longer enough to satisfy their murderous rages, and their compulsion is satisfied by nothing less than killing people. We believe that serial killers are unconsciously terrified of and furious with people because of their own childhoods, and that they kill to temporarily alleviate that terror.</p> <p>As with all murderers, there are more male serial killers than female ones. While it may appear on the surface that some women kill for financial gain - those characterized as "black widows," who benefit from killing family or friends - it's likely that the real reasons they kill are the same as they are for men: to take control, to gain power, and to temporarily conquer the terror inside them. And "temporarily" is a key consideration. At the risk of redundancy, the act of dominance, of killing, must be done over and over again to support the serial killer's delusion that he or she is all-powerful, to reassert superiority.</p> <p>And like all insecure people, serial killers are egotists. They want to be known and feted for their achievements as killing machines. And this, as some of the stories in this book will show, sometimes gets them caught.</p></p><h2>SSAT/ISEE: High School Entrance Examinations (Barron&#39;s Test Prep)</h2><p>This updated manual prepares students to pass either the Secondary School Admissions Test (SSAT) or the Independent School Entrance Exam (ISEE), nationally administered tests used as admission requirements by many private secondary schools. <br><br>Students can improve their test-taking skills by taking the book&#x2019;s two practice SSAT exams or its two practice ISEE exams.

The blow-by-blow narrative of the assault, beginning with the helicopter crash that could have ended Owen&#x2019;s life straight through to the radio call confirming Bin Laden&#x2019;s death, is an essential piece of modern history.<br><br> In <i>No Easy Day</i>, Owen also takes readers into the War on Terror and details the formation of the most elite units in the military. Owen&#x2019;s story draws on his youth in Alaska and describes the SEALs&#x2019; quest to challenge themselves at the highest levels of physical and mental endurance. With boots-on-the-ground detail, Owen describes several missions that illustrate the life and work of a SEAL and the evolution of the team after the events of September 11.<br><br> In telling the true story of the SEALs whose talents, skills, experiences, and exceptional sacrifices led to one of the greatest victories in the War on Terror, Mark Owen honors the men who risk everything for our country, and he leaves readers with a deep understanding of the warriors who keep America safe.</p><p><b>MARK OWEN</b>, author of <i>No Easy Day </i>and <i>No Hero</i>, is a former member of the U.S. Naval Special Warfare Development Group, commonly known as SEAL Team Six. In his many years as a Navy SEAL, he has participated in hundreds of missions around the globe, including the rescue of Captain Richard Phillips in the Indian Ocean in 2009. Owen was a team leader on Operation Neptune Spear in Abbottabad, Pakistan, on May 1, 2011, which resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden. Owen was one of the first men through the door on the third floor of the terrorist mastermind's hideout, where he witnessed Bin Laden's death.<br><br> <b>KEVIN MAURER </b>has covered special operations forces for nine years. He has been embedded with the Special Forces in Afghanistan six times, spent a month in 2006 with special operations units in east Africa, and has embedded with U.S. forces in Iraq and Haiti. He is the author of four books, including several about special operations.&#x201c;Mark Owen&#x201d; is a pseudonym for Matt Bissonnette, a Navy SEAL who took part in the 2011 raid on a compound in Pakistan that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden. His muscular memoir was cowritten by Maurer, a journalist who has covered American special-ops forces for nearly a decade, including a stint as an embedded reporter in Iraq. Owen was already a SEAL at the time of the 9/11 attacks; the book begins shortly thereafter, as he is qualifying for the U.S. Naval Special Warfare Development Group (otherwise known as the famed SEAL Team Six), and follows him through various missions, culminating with a detailed account of the planning and execution of the assault on bin Laden&#x2019;s compound. His version of events has already sparked some controversy&#x2014;no surprise there, since the mission itself is still a controversial subject&#x2014;but it doesn&#x2019;t feel as though Owen intended to add fuel to the fire. Incendiary subject matter aside, this might feel somewhat familiar due to its thematic similarities to such books as Anthony Swofford&#x2019;s Jarhead, Evan Wright&#x2019;s Generation Kill, and Mark Bowden&#x2019;s Black Hawk Down. Like those modern classics, No Easy Day doesn&#x2019;t merely tell war stories&#x2014;it also explores the culture of war and what it means to be a soldier.

It contains systematic methods, case studies, and checklists for enhancing executive skills of children from early childhood through adolescence. The book emphasizes an essential multi-tiered continuum of prevention and supports for students with and without disabilities. Updated and expanded chapters on assessment, instruction, and intervention integrate how-to procedures with current research advances. Notable new chapters focus on children with autism and ADHD; several chapters written by teachers apply executive skill concepts to whole-school approaches. This is the most comprehensive and useful resource about executive skills available. It is indispensable as a text for university courses and a resource for education and mental health professionals.&#x201d;--Patti L. Harrison, PhD, School Psychology Program (Emeritus), University of Alabama<br><br> "Outstanding! An invaluable resource for school psychologists, with practical strategies that can be put into action today. This easy-to-read book delivers interventions for executive function difficulties in children--and even ideas for IEP goals. The third edition moves the field forward by focusing on giving students ownership of interventions and involving them in implementation. The clinician will appreciate being able to quickly find ideas for addressing common tasks that students struggle with, like writing a paper."--Julia L. Carrell, PhD, NCSP, school psychologist, Mead School District, Washington<br><br> "This is an essential read for all educators, from the novice teacher to the seasoned veteran. Dawson and Guare provide a fresh lens through which to assess student performance, curriculum design, implementation, and interventions. The prior edition completely changed our conversations with students, parents, and other educators. We have a concrete, value-free common language to identify student strengths and weaknesses that we use to work toward a shared goal of success. The third edition details the process that elementary and secondary teachers are currently using to integrate research-based theory into their daily classroom routines. It includes examples (and resource materials!) showing how to build an executive functioning culture in your classroom and school."--Molly J. Flatley, MEd, Special Education Department Chair, Fairfax County Public Schools, Virginia<br><br> "This is a very welcome third edition of an excellent book that already has a proven track record in schools. Particularly welcome are the new chapters that provide inspiring examples of whole-school approaches as well as the clear guidance for team-based identification, assessment, and targeted support for individual children with underdeveloped executive skills. A 'must read."--Janet Muscutt, MEd, MSc, DEdPsych, CPsychol, FBPS, consultant educational psychologist, Manchester, United Kingdom; Secretary, International School Psychology Association<br><br> "In the third edition of their widely acclaimed book, Dawson and Guare bring their substantial expertise to bear on the pressing question: 'What can we do to enhance executive skills in all students, and, in particular, to help students with self-regulatory difficulties?' The book reviews assessment strategies and offers a wealth of global and specific accommodations and direct interventions, including language appropriate for clinical reports and IEP and 504 Plans. It helpfully discusses when executive function is a primary problem, such as in children with ADHD, when it is a secondary concern to other disabilities, such as in children with autism spectrum disorder, and when it is a weakness but not a disability per se. The new chapters by teachers demonstrate how an everyday model of self-regulation can be incorporated into the classroom."--Peter K. Isquith, PhD, Senior Attending Psychologist, Boston Children&#x2019;s Hospital; Instructor in Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School<br><br> "I appreciate the numerous tools in this volume, including strategies, informal assessments, case studies, and scenarios. Teacher candidates, practicing educators, and specialists could all benefit from the book's many well-illustrated ideas for assessment and intervention.

Washburn, PhD, Department of Teaching, Learning, and Educational Leadership, Binghamton University, State University of New York<br><br> "An excellent update to an already useful book that balances research on executive function with practical application. The third edition emphasizes the importance of students&#x2019; ownership in the development of their executive skills, and provides school/classroom practices to support students in K&#x2013;12 general education classrooms as well as special populations. I recommend this book to all educators who desire a clear understanding of executive function's role in classroom instruction and intervention."--Kathleen Kryza, MA, educational consultant/coach and coauthor of <i>Transformative Teaching</i><br><br> "This book offers educators practical instructional suggestions for students who struggle with executive skills. The teaching practices go beyond basic planning, time management, and other skills typically associated with executive function--specific routines are presented for applying these skills to academic tasks such as taking notes and writing a paper, which is especially helpful for classroom teachers. In the third edition, the new chapter that provides suggestions for obtaining school services through 504 Plans or special education, including wording for IEPs, is particularly useful."--Joan Sedita, MEd, Founder, Keys to Literacy<br><br>"The perfect introductory book to understanding executive skills....We have used this book in our own practice and have given it to clients for their use as well.

After launching a graphic design business and then a family, she began to write and illustrate children&#39;s books, something she&#39;d wanted to do since second grade. Ms. Falwell lives in Gorham, Maine.PreSchool-K-- In this rhyming counting book, an African-American mother and her children shop for and prepare a festive family dinner. At the supermarket, the count begins with one grocery cart and ends with ten hands helping to load the car. Back at home, the father joins in the preparations and the numbers build a second time to "ten hungry folks" seated around a table ready to share a tasty meal of fried chicken and greens. The successful rhyme scheme builds a natural rhythm that helps the simple text read smoothly. Collage illustrations combine colored paper, patterned fabrics, and felt in a clear, uncluttered design. Muted colors and simple shapes are set off by a stark white background. Most of the figures, especially the baby girl with her rounded limbs and bouncing braids, are animated and expressive. At times, however, facial features seem slightly stilted and relentlessly cheerful. Still, this is an appealing glance at a typical extended family. --Joy Fleishhacker, New York Public Library<br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Little Critter: Just Saving My Money (My First I Can Read)</h2><p><p><strong>Join Mercer Mayer&#x2019;s classic and beloved character, Little Critter� as he learns about it what it means to save money.</strong></p><p>Little Critter works hard for his money!</p><p>When Little Critter wants a new skateboard, Dad tells him that he needs to save his own money to buy it!

He tried closing his eyes and then opening them again, to see if it was all some kind of horrible optical illusion. But when he looked again, the pig was still gone, his vast muddy pink bulk nowhere to be seen. In fact, when George examined the situation for a second time, it had gotten worse, not better. The side door of the pigsty, he noticed, was hanging open, which meant someone hadn&#x2019;t shut it properly. And that someone was probably him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Georgie!&#x201d; he heard his mother call from the kitchen. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to start supper in a minute, so you&#x2019;ve only got about an hour. Have you done your homework?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, Mom,&#x201d; he called back in a fake cheery voice.<br> <br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s your pig?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s fine! Fine!&#x201d; said George squeakily. He threw in a few experimental oinks, just to make it sound as though everything was business as usual, here in the small backyard that was full of many, many vegetables and one enormous&#x2014;but now mysteriously absent&#x2014;pig. He grunted a few more times for effect&#x2014;it was very important his mother did not come out into the garden before George had time to think up a plan. How he was going to find the pig, put it back in the sty, close the door, and get back in time for supper, he had no idea. But he was working on it, and the last thing he needed was for one of his parents to appear before he had all the answers.<br> <br><br> <br>George knew the pig was not exactly popular with his parents. His mother and father had never wanted a pig in the backyard, and his dad in particular tended to grind his teeth quite hard when he remembered who lived beyond the vegetable patch. The pig had been a present: One cold Christmas Eve a few years back, a cardboard box full of squeaks and snuffles had been delivered to their front door. When George opened it up, he found a very indignant pink piglet inside. George lifted him carefully out of the box and watched with delight as his new friend skidded around the Christmas tree on his tiny hooflets. There had been a note taped to the box. Dear all! it read. Merry Christmas! This little fellow needs a home&#x2014;can you give him one? Love, Grandma xxx.<br> <br><br> <br>George&#x2019;s dad hadn&#x2019;t been delighted by the new addition to his family. Just because he was a vegetarian, it didn&#x2019;t mean he liked animals. Actually, he preferred plants. They were much easier to deal with: They didn&#x2019;t make a mess or leave muddy hoofprints on the kitchen floor or break in and eat all the cookies left out on the table. But George was thrilled to have his very own pig. The presents he&#x2019;d received from his mom and dad that year were, as usual, pretty awful. The home-knitted purple-and-orange striped sweater from his mom had sleeves that stretched right down to the floor; he had never wanted a xylophone, and he had a hard time looking enthusiastic when he unwrapped a build-your-own ant farm.<br> <br>What George really wanted&#x2014;above all things in the Universe&#x2014;was a computer. But he knew his parents were very unlikely to buy him one. They didn&#x2019;t like modern inventions and tried to do without as many standard household items as they could. Wanting to live a purer, simpler life, they washed all their clothes by hand and didn&#x2019;t own a car and lit the house with candles in order to avoid using any electricity.<br> <br>It was all designed to give George a natural and improving upbringing, free from toxins, additives, radiation, and other such evil phenomena. The only problem was that in getting rid of everything that could possibly harm George, his parents had managed to do away with lots of things that would also be fun for him. George&#x2019;s parents might enjoy going on environmental protest marches or grinding flour to make their own bread, but George didn&#x2019;t. He wanted to go to a theme park and ride on the roller coasters or play computer games or take an airplane somewhere far, far away. Instead, for now, all he had was his pig.<br> <br><br> <br>And a very fine pig he was too. George named him Freddy and spent many happy hours dangling over the edge of the pigsty his father had built in the backyard, watching Freddy root around in the straw or snuffle in the dirt. As the seasons changed and the years turned, George&#x2019;s piglet got bigger&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and bigger&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and bigger&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. until he was so large that in dim lighting he looked like a baby elephant. The bigger Freddy grew, the more he seemed to feel cooped up in his pigsty. Whenever he got the chance, he liked to escape and rampage across the vegetable patch, trampling on the carrot tops, munching the baby cabbages, and chewing up George&#x2019;s mom&#x2019;s flowers. Even though she often told George how important it was to love all living creatures, George suspected that on days when Freddy wrecked her garden, she didn&#x2019;t feel much love for his pig. Like George&#x2019;s dad, his mom was a vegetarian, but George was sure he had heard her angrily mutter &#x201c;sausages&#x201d; under her breath when she was cleaning up after one of Freddy&#x2019;s more destructive outings.<br> <br>On this particular day, however, it wasn&#x2019;t the vegetables that Freddy had destroyed. Instead of charging madly about, the pig had done something much worse. In the fence that separated George&#x2019;s garden from the one next door, George suddenly noticed a suspiciously pig-sized hole. Yesterday it definitely hadn&#x2019;t been there, but then yesterday Freddy had been safely shut in his sty. And now he was nowhere to be seen. It meant only one thing&#x2014;that Freddy, in his search for adventure, had burst out of the safety of the backyard and gone somewhere he absolutely should not have gone.<br> <br>Next Door was a mysterious place. It had been empty for as long as George could remember. While all the other houses in the row had neatly kept backyards, windows that twinkled with light in the evenings, and doors that slammed as people ran in and out, this house just sat there&#x2014;sad, quiet, and dark. No small children squeaked with joy early in the morning. No mother called out of the back door to bring people in for supper. On the weekends, there was no noise of hammering or smell of fresh paint because no one ever came to fix the broken window frames or clear the sagging gutters. Years of neglect meant the garden had rioted out of control until it looked like the Amazon jungle had grown up on the other side of the fence.<br> <br>On George&#x2019;s side, the backyard was neat, orderly, and very boring. There were rows of string beans strictly tied to stakes, lines of floppy lettuces, frothy dark green carrot tops, and well-behaved potato plants. George couldn&#x2019;t even kick a ball without it landing splat in the middle of a carefully tended blueberry bush and squashing it.<br> <br><br> <br>George&#x2019;s parents had marked out a little area for George to grow his own vegetables, hoping he would become interested in gardening and perhaps grow up to be an organic farmer. But George preferred looking up at the sky to looking down at the earth. So his little patch of the planet stayed bare and scratchy, showing nothing but stones, scrubby weeds, and bare ground, while he tried to count all the stars in the sky to find out how many there were.<br> <br>Next Door, however, was completely different. George often stood on top of the pigsty roof and gazed over the fence into the glorious tangled forest beyond. The sweeping bushes made cozy little hidey-holes, while the trees had curved, gnarled branches, perfect for a boy to climb. Brambles grew in great clumps, their spiky arms bending into strange, wavy loops, crisscrossing each other like train tracks at a station. In summer, twisty bindweed clung on to every other plant in the garden like a green cobweb; yellow dandelions sprouted everywhere; prickly poisonous giant hogweed loomed like a species from another planet, while little blue forget-me-not flowers winked prettily in the crazy bright green jumble of Next Door&#x2019;s backyard.<br> <br><br> <br>But Next Door was also forbidden territory. George&#x2019;s parents had very firmly said no to the idea of George using it as an extra playground. And it hadn&#x2019;t been their normal sort of no, which was a wishy-washy, kindly, we&#x2019;re-asking-you-not-to-for-your-own-sake sort of no. This had been a real no, the kind you didn&#x2019;t argue with. It was the same no that George had encountered when he tried suggesting that, as everyone else at school had a television set&#x2014;some kids even had one in their bedroom!&#x2014;maybe his parents could think about buying one. On the subject of television, George had had to listen to a long explanation from his father about how watching mindless trash would pollute his brain. But when it came to Next Door, he didn&#x2019;t even get a lecture from his dad. Just a flat, conversation-ending no.<br> <br>George, however, always liked to know why. Guessing he wasn&#x2019;t going to get any more answers from his dad, he asked his mother instead.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, George,&#x201d; she had sighed as she chopped up Brussels sprouts and turnips and threw them into the cake mix. She tended to cook with whatever came to hand rather than with ingredients that would actually combine to make something tasty. &#x201c;You ask too many questions.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I just want to know why I can&#x2019;t go next door,&#x201d; George persisted. &#x201c;And if you tell me, I won&#x2019;t ask any more questions for the rest of the day. I promise.&#x201d;<br> <br>His mom wiped her hands on her flowery apron and took a sip of nettle tea. &#x201c;All right, George,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you a story if you stir the muffins.&#x201d; Passing over the big brown mixing bowl and the wooden spoon, she settled herself down as George started to beat the stiff yellow dough with the green and white vegetable speckles together.<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;When we first moved here,&#x201d; his mom began, &#x201c;when you were very small, an old man lived in that house. We hardly ever saw him, but I remember him well. He had the longest beard I&#x2019;ve ever seen&#x2014;it went right down to his knees. No one knew how old he really was, but the neighbors said he&#x2019;d lived there forever.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What happened to him?&#x201d; asked George, who&#x2019;d already forgotten that he&#x2019;d promised not to ask any more questions.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nobody knows,&#x201d; said his mom mysteriously.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; asked George, who had stopped stirring.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just that,&#x201d; said his mom. &#x201c;One day he was there. The next day he wasn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe he went on vacation,&#x201d; said George.<br> <br>&#x201c;If he did, he never came back,&#x201d; said his mom. &#x201c;Eventually they searched the house, but there was no sign of him. The house has been empty ever since and no one has ever seen him again.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Gosh,&#x201d; said George.<br> <br>&#x201c;A little while back,&#x201d; his mom continued, blowing on her hot tea, &#x201c;we heard noises next door&#x2014;banging sounds in the middle of the night. There were flashing lights and voices as well. Some squatters had broken in and were living there. The police had to throw them out. Just last week we thought we heard the noises again. We don&#x2019;t know who might be in that house. That&#x2019;s why your dad doesn&#x2019;t want you going around there, Georgie.&#x201d;<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>As George looked at the big black hole in the fence, he remembered the conversation he&#x2019;d had with his mom. The story she&#x2019;d told him hadn&#x2019;t stopped him from wanting to go Next Door&#x2014;it still looked mysterious and enticing. But wanting to go Next Door when he knew he couldn&#x2019;t was one thing; finding out he actually had to was quite another. Suddenly Next Door seemed dark, spooky, and very scary.<br> <br>George felt torn. Part of him just wanted to go home to the flickery candlelight and funny familiar smells of his mother&#x2019;s cooking, to close the back door and be safe and snug inside his own house once more. But that would mean leaving Freddy alone and possibly in danger. He couldn&#x2019;t ask his parents for any help in case they decided that this was the final black mark against Freddy&#x2019;s name and packed him off to be made into bacon. Taking a deep breath, George decided he had to do it. He had to go Next Door.<br> <br>Closing his eyes, he plunged through the hole in the fence.<br> <br>When he came out on the other side and opened his eyes, he was right in the middle of the jungle garden. Above his head, the tree cover was so dense he could hardly see the sky. It was getting dark now, and the thick forest made it even darker. George could just see where a path had been trampled through the enormous weeds. He followed it, hoping it would lead him to Freddy.<br> <br>He waded through great banks of brambles, which grabbed at his clothes and scratched his bare skin. They seemed to reach out in the semidarkness to scrape their prickly spines along his arms and legs. Muddy old leaves squished under his feet, and nettles attacked him with their sharp, stinging fingers. All the while the wind in the trees above him made a singing, sighing noise, as though the leaves were saying, Be careful, Georgie&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. be careful, Georgie.<br> <br><br> <br>The trail brought George into a sort of clearing right behind the house itself. So far he had not seen or heard any sign of his wayward pig. But there, on the broken paving stones outside the back door, he saw only too clearly a set of muddy hoofprints. From the marks, George could tell exactly which way Freddy had gone. His pig had marched straight into the abandoned house through the back door, which had been pushed open just wide enough for a fat pig to squeeze through. Worse, from the house where no one had lived for years and years, a beam of light shone.<br> <br>Somebody was home.</p><h2>The World Beneath: The Life and Times of Unknown Sea Creatures and Coral Reefs</h2><p><p><b>Meet the world's most fascinating sea creatures&#x2014;see the lives and curiosities of colorful fish and coral reefs&#x2014;this spectacular volume has more than 300 color photos and extraordinary text from a leading marine biologist and underwater photographer, and an international expert on seahorses.</b></p> <p>In this richly informative volume, brimming with new discoveries and more than three hundred colorful images of jaw-dropping fish and coral reefs, you'll swim in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans; you'll be dazzled in the Coral Triangle and amazed in Triton Bay.

He lives in Athens, Georgia.INTRODUCTION<br><br>I have been cooking professionally since I was sixteen years old. The past rewarding yet arduous thirty-one years of learning the nuances of food and watching over countless braises, reductions, roasts, and poaches were anchored in teachings that have been culinary bible verse for hundreds of years. Apart from some useful gadgets that have come along, and, I guess, gas and electricity, my cooking techniques are much the same as one would have found in a professional kitchen in France 150 years ago. That timeless foundation has served me well, and changes in food developed at a tectonic pace, at least until fifteen years or so ago.&nbsp;<br><br>One of the biggest changes was that &#x201c;sous vide&#x201d; became a productive and popular technique for cooking. I remember seeing the cooks in my kitchens starting to use the technology, immersing themselves in the parameters and advantages of cooking food, sealed in bags, in a precisely temperaturecontrolled water bath. That has never sounded romantic. But the results were impressive, and I was equally impressed with these younger chefs, maybe five to ten years my junior, the first phalanx of a generation who have completely changed the world of food. Watching them learn new techniques has been a wonder; I still look in admiration, and sometimes I feel like the old curmudgeon: &#x201c;We used to have to cook hundreds of steaks to finally know how to get it medium-rare every single time! Kids these days can <i>just put it in a bag?</i> Oh, and I had to walk miles in the snow to get to my fifteen-hour work shift!&#x201d;<br><br>I jest, but some of that is true, save for the walk to work. I usually took the bus. I guess I am just trying to show you how much cooking really has changed in recent years. Technology has completely altered the way we move and act in the kitchen, re-choreographing the dance of line cooking, with the new moves allowing us to precisely achieve temperatures that were a guessing game before. Steam ovens, tilt skillets, induction burners, Cryovac machines and immersion circulators have us culinarily dancing to a different tune.&nbsp;<br><br>When sous vide cooking equipment became available to restaurants through a company called PolyScience, the circulators looked like they had been pulled from a steampunk science lab, and, well, they pretty much had been. They initially cost $1,000, and fine dining bought in&#x2014;hook, line, and sinker&#x2014;because chefs have a universal yearning to find new ways to produce&nbsp;dishes.&nbsp;<br><br>What sous vide did for restaurants was speed up the final execution of food by having much of the food cooked and ready for reheating or a quick sear before service. It guaranteed consistency through accurate cooking temperatures, and reduced food waste through shrinkage during the cooking process. But the sous vide method also had a huge impact on taste. When you learn how to cook a piece of meat or fish (or anything else) in a water bath, understanding the perfect temperature at which the flesh will set up and be cooked but still retain moisture and flavor, you really change how customers eat and&nbsp;how chefs work. For those chefs taking notes on times and temps and homing in on the exact doneness and texture and flavor of the food they were cooking, sous vide was a game changer.&nbsp;<br><br>The technology is actually pretty basic when it comes to sous vide, and many thermal circulators have come onto the market. These are essentially thermostat-controlled heating devices with a motor that moves the water around at the precise desired temperature. That&#x2019;s it. But, as with many advances in technology, it takes a while for each new gadget to become commonly available, and I can say this with good experience: My dear father was one of the first people to buy the first IBM home computer, which boasted the processing power of today&#x2019;s toasters for about $20,000. Simple economics shows that more competition drives down prices, and when combined with advances partly in production and partly in technology&#x2014;well, the price of the circulators is now pretty universally around the $100 to $200 range, and lots of models are available for under $100. You can spend more for commercially robust versions, but the inexpensive ones will get the job done, with aplomb, in a home kitchen.&nbsp;<br><br>With so many gadgets, electric pots, fancy ovens, and fridges with Wi-Fi connections, why do you need a sous vide setup in today&#x2019;s world? Well, that is a good question. Although ostensibly a tech gadget, the sous vide circulator is truly a great way to nail old-school cooking. It is a way to efficiently and cleanly make you a better cook, and the often long cook times give you the same freedom that the slow cooker does: the power to walk away from the kitchen and return hours later to a nourishing from-scratch meal.&nbsp;<br><br>In fact, sous vide takes that convenience even further: A steak at 129�F is a medium-rare steak, so it can sit in a 129�F water bath for hours and stay a medium-rare steak. You can go run some errands, come back, take a shower, and get that dinner on the table whenever you feel like it. (Okay, okay, technically the steak can&#x2019;t last <i>forever</i> at that temperature&#x2014;it will continue to keep cooking and get mushy-soft if you leave it in there all day&#x2014;but for most intents and purposes, sous vide will serve to hold your food hot for as long as you need it to.)&nbsp;<br><br>And it&#x2019;s not just convenience and precision. There are so many things that you can make&#x2014;or make better&#x2014;with sous vide cooking. It opens up new doors for culinary pursuits.&nbsp;<br><br>In this book, I share recipes that show some of my favorite characteristics of this method of cooking. I walk you through the basic techniques, and the recipes highlight a whole host of ways sous vide can make your cooking easier, more convenient, and more delicious. It might seem that it&#x2019;s from the future, but really, it&#x2019;s part of the lineage that connects us to the days when humans first discovered cooking. It&#x2019;s a way to get us cooking more, at home, for the people around us.</p><h2>Madeline: Activity Book with Stickers</h2><p>It's playtime with Madeline! <br><br>This fun-filled collection of reusable stickers, simple puzzles, and pictures to color features Madeline, Pepito, and other beloved Ludwig Bemelmans characters as they frolic in scenic Paris.

Stine lives in New York with his wife, Jane, and his King Charles spaniel, Minnie. www.RLStine.com.Audio drama is the ideal medium for spooky fun. &#34;Lights Out,&#34; &#34;Suspense,&#34; &#34;The Whistler,&#34; &#34;Inner Sanctum&#34;--these were among the most popular dramatic programs on &#39;40&#39;s radio. The mental exercise that audio gives to the imagination has more positive effects on kids than the mind-numbing boob tube. Perhaps that&#39;s why, when Disney rereleased some of its postwar kids albums on cassette a few years ago, they were sold out within weeks of hitting the shelves. In this instance, even merely serviceable performance does wonders for Stine&#39;s hack writing. Disney has pumped more energy than creativity into the slickly produced title. It&#39;s amiable, briskly paced and safe. Neither parents nor their offspring will find any unpleasant shocks here. When you give it to your kids, tell &#39;em to shut their eyes and give their minds a listen.

She is also the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Someday, Someday, Maybe</i>. Graham has performed on Broadway and appeared in such films as<i> Bad Santa, Because I Said So, </i>and <i>Max</i>. She holds a BA in English from Barnard College and an MFA in acting from Southern Methodist University. She lives in New York and Los Angeles.Fast Forward<br> &nbsp;<br> Some of the most exciting things that happened in my life took place before I turned six years old. I was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, which is awesome right there, but three weeks later, before I even had time to work on my tan, we moved to Japan. JAPAN. The home of my most favorite food ever: mashed peas. Well, that was probably my favorite food back then; what a waste, since I could have been eating spicy tuna rolls with extra wasabi. Damn you, Baby Lauren, and your infantile palate! Well, to be fair, you <i>were</i> an infant. Sorry I yelled.<br> &nbsp;<br> In Tokyo, we lived with my grandmother for a while, and I had a Japanese nanny, or <i>uba</i>&#x2014;which, incidentally, translates to &#x201c;milk mother,&#x201d; something I just found out by looking it up. (Hold, please, while I call my therapist.) Her name was Sato-san, and I loved her, and as a result, my first word was in Japanese. It was <i>o-heso</i>. You might think that&#x2019;s Japanese for &#x201c;mommy&#x201d; or &#x201c;daddy,&#x201d; but no, <i>o-heso</i> is Japanese for &#x201c;belly button,&#x201d; which I think already proves I am a very unusual, deep, and contemplative person and there&#x2019;s really nothing left to say, thank you for buying this book, the end.<br> &nbsp;<br> Wait, a few more things. My mother, the daughter of missionaries, had grown up in Japan and spoke fluent Japanese. She was also incredibly smart and beautiful, a combination that led to my grandmother holding me while we watch my mother, who is on television! Back when there were just three channels in America, and maybe even fewer in Tokyo, and an air of mystery surrounding the whole thing&#x2014;not like today, when the statistical probability of not at some point stumbling onto your own reality show is inconceivably low. Television had only recently been <i>invented</i> then, and there she was actually on it, and I was so little I was probably just thinking about mashed peas again. Or, more likely, my favorite subject: belly buttons.<br> &nbsp;<br> In related news, apparently on some GikiWoogle-type page of mine, I am quoted as saying, &#x201c;Belly buttons are important.&#x201d; Which, while obviously sort of true, medically speaking, taking into account the life-giving properties of the umbilical cord, was also clearly a joke. Yet I can&#x2019;t tell you how many times during an interview a journalist gets that somber I&#x2019;m-going-in-for-the-kill look I love so much and asks me, with knitted-brow faux sincerity: &#x201c;Do you <i>really</i> think belly buttons are important?&#x201d; Let me clear the air once and for all: um, no, I do not. Although this book isn&#x2019;t very long yet and I&#x2019;ve already talked about belly buttons quite a bit. Damn you, tabloid journalists! You wise Truth Uncoverers! Again, sorry&#x2014;the yelling must stop.<br> &nbsp;<br> So, anyway, there she was, my mother, on the largest television available at the time, which was roughly the size of a Rubik&#x2019;s cube. Also, check out her dope sixties Priscilla Presley look! Her ability to speak the language as a non-native was so unusual at the time that she was asked to appear on a Japanese daytime talk show.<br> &nbsp;<br> My parents weren&#x2019;t together very long. They hadn&#x2019;t known each other well when they decided to get married, and then they had me right away, when they were both just twenty-two years old, and&#x2014;well, that about sums it up. They were very, very young. At the time, my mom was also trying to pursue a career as a singer, and it was decided I should stay with my dad. They parted as friends, and my father made the obvious next choice, something we&#x2019;d all probably do in this situation: he moved us to the Virgin Islands, where we lived on a houseboat. I slept in a bunk-bed-type thing that was also the kitchen. I was picked up for nursery school by the bus, which was actually a motorboat. We moved there because&nbsp;. . . <br> &nbsp;<br> You know what? I don&#x2019;t remember exactly. Let&#x2019;s call my dad and ask him. He probably won&#x2019;t pick up because he&#x2019;s on the East Coast, and it&#x2019;s a Saturday in the springtime, so unless it&#x2019;s pouring down rain, he&#x2019;s out playing golf. But I&#x2019;ll give you a visual just in case, so you too can play Call My Dad at home!<br> &nbsp;<br> I know, isn&#x2019;t it a shame we look nothing alike? Okay, let&#x2019;s see if he&#x2019;s home. Ring, ring, ring, ring. I told you. He&#x2019;s probably not&#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> Dad: Hello? <br> Me: Oh, hi! I didn&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;d be home. <br> Dad: It&#x2019;s raining here.<br> Me: Well, then, that explains it. Hey, remind me&#x2014;why did we live on a houseboat that time? <br> Dad: Who is this?<br> Me: You have other children you lived on a houseboat with? <br> Dad: No, I have other children who call me more. <br> Me: Dad, please. I call you all the time. So this is for the book, and&#x2014; <br> Dad: Is this going to be another befuddled father character, like in your last book? <br> Me: Dad, I wouldn&#x2019;t call that character befuddled in general. He&#x2019;s just a little befuddled by technology. <br> Dad: Wait&#x2014;what did you say? I couldn&#x2019;t hear you. I just hit one of these dumb phone buttons wrong. <br> Me: Um, yeah. I was just saying that the father character in my first novel&#x2014;the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Someday, Someday, Maybe</i>, published by Ballantine Books, an imprint of Random House, and now available in paperback&#x2014;is not exactly befuddled, and anyway, he&#x2019;s only a little bit you. <br> Dad: Why are you talking like that? <br> Me: Like what? I was just thinking about how Christmas is right around the corner, but no matter how you choose to celebrate the holidays, books in general make great gifts! <br> Dad: Like that. Like you&#x2019;re selling things to an audience. Are you on <i>Ellen</i> right now? <br> Me: Dad, I wouldn&#x2019;t be calling you from the set of <i>Ellen</i>. <br> Dad: Oh, oh, I&#x2019;m fancy, I live in Hollywood, where people aren&#x2019;t allowed to call their fathers from the set of the <i>Ellen</i> show. <br> Me: Dad, please. Why did we live on the houseboat again?<br> &nbsp;<br> Dad: Well, I was working for that congressman, and the hours were long, and I&#x2019;d drop you off in the morning and not see you until after 6:00 p.m., and I felt bad about that. I wasn&#x2019;t sure I was on the right career path anyway. Also, I was sort of seeing this girl&#x2014;you remember the one who owned the horse? Well, she lived there off and on, and I thought I&#x2019;d go there too, and write, and&nbsp;. . . <br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m going to interrupt my father here (well, actually, he&#x2019;s still talking, so shhh&#x2014;don&#x2019;t tell him). But I have to explain to you that, as a kid, I thought my father never dated anyone at all until he met and married my stepmother. It wasn&#x2019;t until years later that I figured out the young ladies who sometimes came around may have been a wee bit more than the &#x201c;cat sitter,&#x201d; that &#x201c;nice woman I play tennis with,&#x201d; and the &#x201c;girl who owned the horse.&#x201d; And I don&#x2019;t blame them. I mean, who wouldn&#x2019;t want to &#x201c;cat-sit&#x201d; for this guy?<br> &nbsp;<br> By the way, can we talk about the unnecessary thickness of children&#x2019;s belts of the 1970s? I mean look at the&#x2014; Oops, my dad&#x2019;s still on the phone!<br> &nbsp;<br> Dad:&nbsp;. . . and anyway, she knew these people at the marina in St. Thomas. <br> Me: So did we, like, sail around the island and stuff? <br> Dad: Oh, no. The engine didn&#x2019;t work on the boat. <br> Me: The engine didn&#x2019;t&nbsp;. . .? We lived on a giant floating bathtub that went nowhere? <br> Dad: It was a strange place, I&#x2019;ll admit, that marina&#x2014; but friendly. Very bohemian. Everybody there was sort of dropping out from society, which we were too, in a way&#x2014;for weeks after we&#x2019;d left D.C., I&#x2019;m pretty sure my mother still thought I worked on Capitol Hill. But I got to spend more time with you, which was the goal. It was beautiful there. We drove around a lot and went to the beach. It probably seems strange to you now, but it was a 1970s thing to do, I guess. And we had fun. <br> <i>(A pause as we both reminisce.) </i><br> Me: You did a lot for me, Dad. I love you. <br> Dad: I love you too, kid. <br> <i>(Another pause.) </i><br> Dad: <i>Who</i> is this again?<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Alien Next Door 3: Alien Scout</h2><p>In the third book of the Alien Next Door series, Harris knows Zeke is an alien, and they go away for a weekend trip as Beaver Scouts.

The saucer-like monster hovered in the glade. But aside from the strange lights that pulsated from its dome head, the thing had simply hummed a low sound since appearing mysteriously outside the city.<br>&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;Maybe it just wants to make friends,&#x201d; said Big the Cat. The gentle giant reached out a hand toward the saucer&#x2019;s body.<br>&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;Be careful,&#x201d; said Tails, hovering over the scene on the twin helicopter blades that gave him his name. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know what&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; <br>ZAAAANG!<br>&nbsp;<br> It was too late. The moment Big touched the machine, an awful grinding noise emanated from within. The massive metal monster spun around and bore itself into the ground.<br>&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;Submit or be destroyed!&#x201d; cried a hollow, angry voice from within.<br>&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;Well, I think that settles that!&#x201d; Amy ran up from the edge of the glade and called to her team. &#x201c;Big! Cream! Let&#x2019;s give it a little flower power!&#x201d; Without a word, Big opened up his large bamboo umbrella and twirled it over his head. Amy and Cream the Rabbit jumped on top, holding each other&#x2019;s hands and whipping up a furious spinning speed.<br><br>&#x201c;One, two, three&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. GO!&#x201d; Amy called and then let go of Cream to shoot herself at the machine with full force. Her hammer swung around in midair for a mighty blow, and then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>Clang!</i> Amy bounced straight off the whirling body of the saucer! She hit the dirt and rolled to safety, but the machine continued its awful dig, sinking its body firmly into the earth.<br>&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;Submit! Submit! Submit!&#x201d; it called out in a droning tone that set the heroes&#x2019; hairs on end.<br>&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It looks like the top may be vulnerable!&#x201d; yelled Tails over the noise. &#x201c;Try to crush its dome!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>SWOOOSH!<br>&nbsp;<br>In a split second, a blue blaze flew over their heads, nearly blowing the heroes down with its force. The spinning ball of fury shot toward the machine&#x2019;s dome like a bullet and struck it hard and true. The dome crumpled as the blue blur came into focus as Sonic the Hedgehog.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Were you waiting long? Just kidding. I know you weren&#x2019;t,&#x201d; he said with a smirk, and crouched to balance.<br>&nbsp;<br>Underneath him the half-sunken saucer shivered and steamed. &#x201c;Submit! Submit! Submmmmmm&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ,&#x201d; it wheezed before finally splitting wide open. With a wet, sickening sound, the metal body of the monster burst, shooting a torrent of sticky green slime all over Amy&#x2019;s team.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Whoa!&#x201d; said Tails as he zipped high in the air to miss the green goo.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Gross!&#x201d; called Amy. &#x201c;I feel like I got sneezed on by a giant.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oh, my poor Cheese!&#x201d; said Cream, picking up her floating sidekick pal from where he was knocked to the ground.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oh, I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; said Big, sitting calmly in the squishy green slime. &#x201c;It actually feels kind of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. nice.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Hahahaha!&#x201d; laughed Sonic. &#x201c;Sorry to say, but that&#x2019;s what happens when you&#x2019;re not the fastest thing alive.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Without the robotic saucer body, all that was left of the machine was a tall metal spire. In its middle sat a large green meteor rock that continued to pulsate with strange light, even as it dripped the disgusting discharge.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll have to contact a medical team to decontaminate you,&#x201d; Tails said. &#x201c;Standard procedure.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Have fun waiting to get hosed off,&#x201d; said Sonic as he swung outside the slime radius with Tails&#x2019; help. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got more action to find instead of getting stuck in place.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br><br> The next day, Sonic sped through town in search of some fun. Street after street, the scene was calm and quiet. No explosions or attacks or action of any kind. Except at&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Cream and Cheese&#x2019;s house?<br>&nbsp;<br>Out front, the kindly rabbit and her partner were making a racket of clangs from a mountain of sheet metal. Cream struck a large wrench against the warped pile again and again. Sparks flew each time she struck, some jumping into Cheese&#x2019;s eyes. But neither of them seemed to care.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Uh, hey, Cream,&#x201d; Sonic said as he skidded into her driveway. &#x201c;Working on an art project?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We are building the spear,&#x201d; said the rabbit without stopping.<br><br>&#x201c;Right, the spear&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Sonic didn&#x2019;t know exactly what to say. &#x201c;And you think a wrench is going to shape that metal up the way you want?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Cream stopped her motion mid-swing. She pulled the tool down slowly and stared at it for a long moment. The quiet made Sonic uncomfortable. &#x201c;Perhaps you are right,&#x201d; she said at last.<br><br>The wrench dropped with a thud, and Cream reached up her hands to grab the metal firmly. With surprising strength and an agonizing squeaking sound, the rabbit folded two pieces of strong metal together as though they were paper. She started to mold and shape the pile like clay.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Wow!&#x201d; said Sonic. &#x201c;Have you been working out?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The little Chao creature that followed Cream everywhere floated up to Sonic&#x2019;s nose. &#x201c;Chao.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Cream explained to Sonic that this meant they had been strengthened and wanted Sonic to join them.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Um&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&#x2019;ve got somewhere else to be,&#x201d; Sonic said and sped away before he got too close.<br>&nbsp;<br>The strange encounter drove Sonic across the city to Amy&#x2019;s home. If anyone knew what was going on with those two, it would be their best friend. But when Sonic arrived, Amy didn&#x2019;t charge out to greet him.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Amy? Anyone home?&#x201d; Sonic called into the curiously open door. When no one answered, he walked in&#x2014;carefully, in case there was an ambush waiting. But what he found was almost too boring: Amy and a room of maps.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;This planet has so many people on it,&#x201d; she said without looking up. Amy leaned over a massive map of the planet. Pinned on every wall were charts of country borders and city streets. She was totally absorbed.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Planning a trip?&#x201d; Sonic asked and forced a flat chuckle.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The trip is over,&#x201d; she said slowly. &#x201c;All that&#x2019;s left now is to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ah, ah, AH-CHOO!&#x201d; Amy sneezed, covering her mouth with her hand, but Sonic noticed that her hands were now covered in green slime!<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Gross!&#x201d; said Sonic.<br>&nbsp;<br>Amy just looked at him with an empty stare. She slowly reached out her slime-covered hands. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s fine,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Touch it and you&#x2019;ll see.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>In a blur, Sonic was gone again, roaming the streets for answers to whatever had happened to his friends. No matter how fast he ran, no answers came. Then it hit him. The slime! The crash site must hold the answers to what was happening.<br>&nbsp;<br>Within seconds, Sonic was back on the outskirts of town and rushing into the quiet glade. What met him there was another friend. Or was it?<br>&nbsp;<br>Big sat still as a stone in the blackened pit that the saucer had dug. While his back was to Sonic, it was clear the large purple cat was staring up at the dented meteorite that still glowed an eerie shade of green.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Hey, pal,&#x201d; Sonic called, trying to sound normal. &#x201c;Fish ain&#x2019;t biting today?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Fish?&#x201d; Big finally said. &#x201c;No!

This time I&#x2019;m writing a letter.</i> So begins this heartfelt picture book about a girl who prefers running and jumping to listening and learning&#x2014;and the teacher who gently inspires her. From stomping through creeks on a field trip to pretending to choke when called upon to read aloud, this book&#x2019;s young heroine would be a challenge to any teacher. But this teacher isn&#x2019;t just any teacher. By listening carefully and knowing just the right thing to say, she quickly learns that the girl&#x2019;s unruly behavior is due to her struggles with reading. And at the very end, we learn what this former student is now: a teacher herself.</p><p>Deborah Hopkinson is the author of many highly acclaimed picture books, including <i>Beatrix Potter and the Unfortunate Tale of a Borrowed Guinea Pig;</i> <i>Sky Boys: How They Built the Empire State Building,</i> a <i>Boston Globe&#x2013;Horn Book</i> Honor Book; and <i>Abe Lincoln Crosses a Creek: A Tall, Thin Tale,</i> an ALA-ALSC Notable Children&#x2019;s Book.

She lives in Brooklyn, New York.Gr 1&#x2013;3&#x2014;A young woman reflects on her experiences as an energetic, impatient child by writing a letter to the teacher who nevertheless managed to make second grade "the best year ever." As the narrator's childhood antics are disclosed, adult readers will appreciate the teacher's ability to channel the girl's curiosity into her learning. Young readers may find the book a bit too sentimental, however, since the narrator's exploits lack the ingenuity of her teacher's attempts to reel her in, and fade in comparison with those of some of her wayward fictional counterparts. Each vignette from the year is illustrated in muted pen-and-ink with splashes of color, and the characters' expressions evoke their emotions as they navigate what it means to teach and to learn. The tale will resonate with those looking for an intimate portrayal of the relationship between student and teacher, who will appreciate the light it shines on the ways in which teachers can impact their students long after the single year they spend together is over. VERDICT This tender story of a recalcitrant student and the teacher she never forgot will likely touch the hearts of adults, but its nostalgic retrospective narration will leave many children unmoved.&#x2014;Anna Stover, Poughkeepsie Day School, NY</p><h2>If Only I Had a Green Nose (Max Lucado&#39;s Wemmicks)</h2><p>Punchinello learns that it can be difficult, foolish, and even dangerous to try to keep up with the latest fads and that Eli, his maker, gave each Wemmick different characteristics on purpose.</p><p><p><strong>Max Lucado</strong> (MA, Abilene Christian University) serves as the minister of preaching at Oak Hills Church in San Antonio, Texas, and is a best-selling author and speaker.

Can you help the little boy find the monster that matches his drawing so he can go to sleep?<br><br> In Are You My Monster?, a monster-loving boy tries to find his monster. He compares his drawing&#x2014;showing a green monster with a long tail, pointy nails, and big teeth&#x2014;with an assortment of amusing monsters, until he finds the perfect match. This turns out to be his beloved STUFFED monster toy. Youngest children will love comparing colors, checking if tails are long or short, if nails are pointy or round, if teeth are big or small until they, too, find the monster who is a perfect match.</p><p><b>Howard McWilliam</b> is the award-winning illustrator of <i>I Need My Monster, Hey, That's MY Monster!, When a Dragon Moves In, </i>and <i>When a Dragon Moves In Again</i>, along with many other children's books.

Ethan makes a drawing of his monster. After all, only one monster is the monster for him. One by one, the monsters appear, and Ethan goes down his checklist to see if they are the one he's looking for. Sharp teeth, a long tale, green and... some criteria are met. Others not. As the monster go by and none seem to fulfill his entire list, the question of whether or not he'll ever find his monster arises. Not only are the monster super sweet (in a scary, monstery way, of course), but the check list is something readers are sure to enjoy. Every two-page spread has a monster on one side, and Ethan and his list on the other. It's a simple concept and that's exactly what makes it fun. Young listeners will easily be sucked into Ethan's search and join in as each aspect of the monster is explored. The illustrations are bright and bring across the right atmosphere. Each monster packs their own personality, and young readers are sure to find their own personal favorites.

Whether you want to proudly announce to the world that you're a nasty woman or remind others that a woman's place is in&nbsp; the revolution, you&#x2019;ll find edgy slogans, sharp one-liners, and cheeky images that make fabulous wall art or wonderful handmade gifts. An illustrated basics section will get you started, with information on materials, tools, techniques, and framing your finished pieces.</p><p>Stephanie Rohr&#x2014;known in the craft world as stephXstitch&#x2014;has been designing cross-stitch for over 10 years, and she started her business stephXstitch in 2010 (stephxstitch.com). Stephanie's designs have been featured on <i>Cross-Stitcher</i> magazine, <i>Mr. X-Stitch, </i>Huffington Post, BuzzFeed, Bust, and more. Stephanie lives in Chicago.&#x201c;&#x2019;Nasty women&#x2019; will find much to cross-stitch in Rohr&#x2019;s sharp-needled pattern book of designs for &#x2018;craftivist&#x2019; feminists. After a childhood of traditional cross-stitching, Rohr began her &#x2018;subversive&#x2019; cross-stitch career in 2010, moving it into higher gear after the 2016 presidential election. She declares that cross-stitch, once dismissed as mere &#x2018;women&#x2019;s work,&#x2019; is now being acknowledged both as an art form in its own right and as a way for crafters to &#x2018;express their opinions, show support for marginalized groups, and protest.&#x2019; Rohr begins the book&#x2019;s instructional component by clearly covering the basics: Aida cloth, DMC floss, large-eyed tapestry needles, and hoops for tautness and/or framing. The 40 patterns fill chapters from &#x2018;Stitched Affirmations&#x2019; (&#x2018;Believe Women&#x2019; and &#x2018;Smash the Patriarchy&#x2019;) to &#x2018;Sassy &amp; Subversive&#x2019; (&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t Tell Me to Smile&#x2019; resembles folk art); from &#x2018;Politically Active&#x2019; (with quotes from Michelle Obama, Emmeline Pankhurst, and Maxine Waters, among others) to &#x2018;Feminist Iconography&#x2019; with rainbow flags. Each pattern is marked with a cross-stitch icon denoting the project&#x2019;s difficulty level, ranging from one to six stitches, with the toughest project being, fittingly, a Rosie the Riveter pattern. Each design is clearly graphed, and Rohr encourages free adaptations. The patterns, &#x2018;bold and fierce&#x2019; indeed, will speak to stitchers who share Rohr&#x2019;s spirit and convictions.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br> &#x201c;Like feminism, cross-stitch is for everyone, Rohr says in her first book of patterns. These creations follow the subversive cross-stitch theme first popularized by Julie Jackson (<i>Subversive Cross Stitch</i>, 2006): simple, traditional-looking patterns expressing surly sentiments. Standouts here include a folk-art inspired &#x2018;Don't Tell Me to Smile&#x2019; and a sweet, floral pattern that proclaims &#x2018;A woman's place is in the Revolution&#x2019; For crafters who appreciate Rohr's sense of humor, the rampant profanity (e.g., &#x2018;Feminist as Fuck&#x2019;) won't be a problem, and there are plenty of patterns that, like &#x2018;Reclaiming my time,&#x2019; are G-rated. The skill level required for each pattern is indicated, and the difficulty level progresses from those for beginning stitchers that use just a few colors to an impressive Rosie the Riveter for pros. Instructions and supply resources are well covered. <i>Feminist Cross-Stitch </i>is very much on-trend as a new generation discovers the joys of needlework, and libraries looking to freshen up their craft collections should start here.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Booklist</i><br><br> &#x201c;Stephanie&#x2019;s book is a treasure&#x2014;like having a best friend by your side teaching you the craft step by step. She truly understands the therapeutic value of reclaiming what was once traditional &#x2018;women&#x2019;s work&#x2019; as a modern, empowering medium. Her designs are spot-on and well executed with clear, encouraging instructions. There are very few people who really &#x2018;get&#x2019; subversive cross-stitch the way Stephanie does.&#x201d; &#x2014;Julie Jackson, founder of Subversive Cross Stitch</p><h2>Little Owl&#39;s Colors</h2><p>During daytime, Little Owl&#x2019;s forest is full of colors&#x2014;like the sparkling blue pond and the hungry green frog sitting on a grassy green bank.

Soon only the tiniest seed remains, growing into a giant flower and, when autumn returns, sending its own seeds into the wind to start the process over again.Eric Carle is an internationally bestselling and award-winning author and illustrator of more than seventy books for very young children, including <i>The Tiny Seed</i>, <i>Papa, Please Get the Moon for Me</i>,&nbsp;and his most well-known title, <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i>.

You never can tell, so you eventually learn to live without a rooting interest in the parade of stars, musicians, sports champions, and politicians. And you lose the ability to participate in the <i>real</i> American pastime: beating up on people you don't like and glorifying people you do.</p><p>I had not yet learned that truism when he and I first met. I was at a point where I was deeply unhappy with my personal life, increasingly frustrated about where my career seemed to be going&#x2014;although from the outside it would probably appear to anyone observing that I was among the most blessed twenty-four-year-olds on the planet. In an effort to find substance, meaning, and excitement, I had become deeply involved in the world of politics.</p><p>It was at one of these political events, the kind where movie stars mix with political stars, each trading in the other's reflective glory, both looking to have the other fill something missing inside them, that we were introduced. "Rob Lowe, I'd like you to meet John Kennedy Jr.," someone said. "Hey, man, good to meet you," I said. He smiled. We shook hands and I was relieved that my by then ex-girlfriend wasn't there to notice that he was slightly taller than I was, or to comment on who had better-looking hair. We made some small talk, and I remember thinking, <i>How does he do it? How does he carry the scrutiny? How does he attempt a normal life? Is it even possible? Is it even worth trying?</i></p><p>He was charming and gracious and didn't seem to be unnerved by the multitudes of eyeballs stealing glances as we spoke. Eventually, as we were both single guys in our twenties, the talk turned to girls. "Maybe we should get outta here, go find where the action is," he said. I looked at him. "Dude. You're fucking JFK Jr.! All right?! You don't need to go anywhere!" He looked at me and laughed, and as he did I saw a glimpse of his father and was reminded of his family's legacy of sacrifice and tragedy, and was glad that he was carrying the mantle so well and with so much promise for the future.</p><p>Eventually we went our separate ways, never teaming up to hunt down any fun that night (although I later wrestled open a wet bar at 2:00 a.m. with a vice presidential short-list candidate). Over the years I watched him navigate the currents of fame, dating, and career ups and downs, curious to see how his life would play out. Sometimes he and I would both appear on those shameful lists of "Hunks." (Could there be a more degrading or, frankly, gross word than "hunk"? Hunk of what? Hunk of wood? Hunk of cheese? Yikes!) There may have even been a girl or two whom we both coveted, but that was the extent of my contact with him.</p><p>In the late '90s my wife, Sheryl, and I were on a romantic ski vacation in Sun Valley, Idaho. We still felt like newlyweds, in spite of having two beautiful baby boys from whom we'd escaped for a rare evening out. Sun Valley is one of my favorite spots. It's old school (as the site of North America's first chair lift) and glamorous (the home of Hemingway and early Hollywood royalty), and boasts one of the greatest ski mountains in the country. I had been going there since the mid-'80s and always liked the mix of people you might encounter at any given time. One evening at a big holiday party, I felt a tap on the shoulder. It was John Jr. "How've you been, man?" he asked with a smile. I introduced him to Sheryl. He congratulated us on our marriage. After a while Sheryl went off on her own, leaving the two of us alone in the corner watching the party move on around us. Even in this more rarefied crowd, you could feel the occasional glare of curious observation. A ski instructor passed by, a movie star; a local ski bunny brushed by John and flipped her hair. "How did you do it?" he asked, so low against the buzz of the party that I couldn't quite hear.</p><p>"I'm sorry?"</p><p>"How did you do it?" he repeated. "I mean how did you settle down? You of all people."</p><p>I looked at him and he was smiling, almost laughing, as if covering something else, some other emotion, something I couldn't quite discern. At first I thought he might be gently poking fun at me; up until my marriage, my life had been publicly marked by a fair number of romances, some covered with great interest in the papers. But I saw that his question was real, and that he seemed to be grappling with a sort of puzzle he could not solve. I realized he was looking across the room to a willowy blonde. She had fantastic blue eyes, and the kind of beauty and magnetism that was usually reserved for film stars. She was standing next to my wife, Sheryl, also a blue-eyed blonde with a beauty and presence that made her seem as if a spotlight and wind machine were constantly trained on her.</p><p>I put two and two together. "Looks like you have a great girl. That's half the battle right there. She's obviously amazing and if she's your best friend, marry her. You can do it. Don't let anyone tell you that you can't, that you're not ready, or not capable. Come on in, man, the water's warm. I'm here to tell you it is; if she's your friend in addition to all of the other stuff, pull the trigger, don't let her get away. You never know what life will bring."</p><p>I think he was a little taken aback at the passion of my response. I'm not at all sure what he had expected me to say. But he asked, so what the hell. John nodded and we went on to other topics. The next day, we met to ski on the mountain he snowboarded, ripping down the face, fast and free. But the weather was turning and a white-out was upon us. In the snow and the speed and the wind, we were separated. I looked up over a ridge and he was gone, lost in the clouds.</p><p>John did marry his blonde, his Carolyn. I was glad for him and thought about sending him a note, but somehow I didn't (of all my character flaws&#x2014;and there are a number of them&#x2014;procrastination is one of the most distinctive). Instead I wished him luck, children, and longevity of love with one of my nonalcoholic beers as I watched the coverage on <i>Entertainment Tonight.</i> As a political junkie and unashamed admirer of our country, I was a huge fan of his brainchild, <i>George</i> magazine. When someone finally stopped asking celebrities appearing on its cover to pose in those George Washington wigs I thought: Okay, they're rollin' now!</p><p>The end of the century approached. The '90s were a time of building for me. Building a life that was sober, drained of harmful, wasteful excess and manufacturing in its place a family of my own. This was my priority through the decade and that work continues to pay off today with the love of my sons, Matthew and Johnowen, and the constant gift of the love of my wife, Sheryl. Whereas the '80s had been about building a career, the '90s ended with my having built a life.</p><p>At the end of the decade, my career was very much in flux, just as it had been at the end of the previous one. I had had some successes in the '90s, always made money, but the truth was I was like a man pushing a boulder up a hill. A huge, heavy, difficult boulder made up of some career mistakes, projects that didn't meet expectations, and twenty years of being a known quantity. And not only not being the new sensation, but worse, being someone people in Hollywood took for granted, someone with no surprises left in him. For example, the ability to appear on the cover of magazines is critical for any major actor. It's just a fact of the business end of show business. And I hadn't been on the cover of a magazine in almost ten years. To have the kind of career one aspires to, comprising good, major work over the course of a lifetime, it was critical that I find two things: the breakout, watershed project to remind people what I could accomplish as an actor, and that first magazine cover and profile to publicize it. It was June of 1999 and John Kennedy Jr. was about to help me get both.</p><p>My longtime publicist Alan Nierob was on the line. "Apparently JFK Jr. stood up in today's staff meeting and said he had just seen a pilot for a new TV series that was the embodiment of everything he founded <i>George</i> magazine to be. He was emotional about it, very moved by the show and inspired to help people hear about it. He thinks <i>The West Wing</i> can be one of those once-in-a-lifetime shows that can change people's lives. Your character of Sam Seaborn was his favorite and he wants to put you on <i>George</i>'s September cover."</p><p>Although the advance copy of <i>The West Wing</i> had been receiving freakishly unanimous raves, I was ecstatic and humbled by this particular endorsement. It's impossible to imagine living JFK Jr.'s life and then watching a show whose central theme was the heart and soul of the American presidency. His whole world has been shaped by the office, the service to it, and the tragic sacrifice in its name. <i>The West Wing</i> was going to be about "the best and the brightest." His father's administration all but coined the phrase.</p><p>"Um, Alan, does John realize that there is no guarantee that the show will last through the fall?" I knew that <i>George</i> was in ser...</p></p><h2>Yo! Yes?

He lives with his wife and son in New York City.PreSchool-Grade 2-- An effective, unusual 34-word story of the beginnings of a friendship, accompanied by wild and wonderful illustrations. Against pastel backgrounds, in vibrant, colorful images, an African-American boy and a white boy meet on the street. "What's up?" "Not much." "Why?" "No fun." "Oh?" "No friends." These one- and two-word exchanges on each spread lead to a tentative offer of friendship, sealed as both boys jump high in the air and yell "Yow!" The succinct, rhythmic text and the strong cartoonlike watercolor-and-charcoal illustrations are perfect complements. The feelings of each child run the gamut from loneliness, curiosity, fear of rejection, and hopefulness to, finally, joy; the illustrations do a particularly fine job of limning each boy's emotions in very simple images on the oversized pages. With a beautifully balanced, economical style, the book illumines the peaks and pitfalls of getting acquainted, and puts in a good word for brotherhood as well. Amusing for story times, or for use in discussions of feelings, it is fun to read and look at, and appealing to the eye, ear, and heart.

Their favorite activities are eating, sleeping, and digging holes. Here, in the words of one unusually articulate wombat, is the tongue-in-cheek account of a busy week; eating, sleeping, digging holes . . . and training its new neighbors, a family of humans, to produce treats on demand. This entertaining book, with its brief, humorous text and hilarious illustrations, will endear the wombat to young children, who may recognize in the determined furry creature some qualities that they share.</p><p>Jackie French is a highly esteemed writer for children and adults with more than 100 books to her credit. She lives in Australia with her family and usually one or more wombats. Her web site is www.jackiefrench.com.<br><br>Bruce Whatley was born in Wales and now lives with his family in Australia. He has illustrated more than 50 children's books, some of which he also wrote.&nbsp;What, exactly, do wombats do all day? One enterprising wombat answers that question and a few others in diary form in French&#39;s (No Such Thing) tongue-in-cheek picture book. After explaining his unique Australian heritage, the star of this volume paints a funny, if rather dull, picture of his daily routine. &#34;Monday Morning: Slept./Afternoon: Slept./ Evening: Ate grass./ Scratched./ Night: Ate grass.&#34; Things begin to perk up, however, when the wombat discovers its new human neighbors. Before long, the always-hungry creature is at their door begging for food (preferably carrots or oats), digging in their garden (&#34;Began new hole in soft dirt&#34;) and turning his neighbors&#39; belongings into scratching posts. Happily, the human family appears to take the antics of their adopted wild &#34;pet&#34; in stride (though the wombat sees things a bit differently &#34;Have decided that humans are easily trained and make quite good pets&#34;). Whatley (the Detective Donut books) appears to relish this character study; he paints the chocolate-brown wombat in numerous poses and expressions--rolling, scratching, sleeping, chewing--on an ample white background. The artist gives the star expressive eyes without anthropomorphizing her. The often cuddly looking wombat may leave some readers envious of its languid lifestyle.

She's taken the flight from Honolulu to the Midway Atoll, a group of Pacific islands where her parents live, many times. When she has to get to Midway in a hurry after a visit with her aunt in Hawaii, she gets on the next cargo flight at the last minute. She knows the pilot, but on this flight, there's a new co-pilot named Max. All systems are go until a storm hits during the flight.

She lives in Oregon with her family.</p>one <br>&nbsp; <br>The dude with the lime-green Mohawk and dark wooden plugs in his earlobes looked down at me, the long silver needle in his rubber-gloved hand pointed directly at my face. <br>&#x201c;Wait.&#x201d; I swallowed and gripped the arms of my chair. <br>Jutting out one hip, he rolled his eyes. &#x201c;Do you want your nose pierced or not?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, just&nbsp;&#x2026; can you tell me something worse?&#x201d; I pointed at the needle. &#x201c;Something that is worse than that?&#x201d; <br>He probably thought my request was insane, but that was how I coped with unpleasant things. Once I found out something worse, then it was easier to deal with. Whether it was a filling at the dentist or an end-of-term physics test, finding out things that were worse helped me deal with new challenges. <br>Green Mohawk Dude seemed to think about it as he looked around. A blond pregnant woman in tall suede boots and a fuchsia halter dress browsed through the gold hoops. With one gloved finger, he pointed at her. &#x201c;Childbirth. Fairly certain that hurts worse.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fifteen.&#x201d; My turn to eye roll. &#x201c;Something a little more relative? Not so obviously inappropriate?&#x201d; I got ready to leave. <br>He pointed down at his black flip-flops. &#x201c;See my big toes?&#x201d; <br>My glance went downward and I flinched. His toes were big and callousy with yellowish nails. Easily the ugliest toes I&#x2019;d ever seen. <br> <i>Sick.</i> <br>Green Mohawk Dude said, &#x201c;Last year I climbed Mount Kilimanjaro. Coming down, my toes got smashed into the front of my boots. Ended up losing both my big toenails. Took them eleven months to grow back.&#x201d; <br>I asked, &#x201c;And that hurt worse than getting your nose pierced?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Guess so.&#x201d; He shrugged. &#x201c;Now, can we do this?&#x201d; <br>Nodding, I closed my eyes as he shoved the needle through my skin. <br>A rush of stinging flooded up my nose. &#x201c;Holy crap!&#x201d; My eyes watered so bad I had to blink like crazy, then I finally gave up and kept them shut for a while. When I did open them again, first I glared at the green-haired liar standing in front of me, then looked in the mirror to check out the diamond adorning my nose. &#x201c;Sweet.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No swimming in pools for a month. Even though they&#x2019;re chlorinated, they could have germs. And lakes, rivers&nbsp;&#x2026; avoid those. The ocean too. Just to be safe. You don&#x2019;t want to get it infected.&#x201d; He handed me a plastic baggie with alcohol swabs and Xeroxed instructions. &#x201c;So now you can go back to the mainland with the new look you got in Honolulu.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Um, yeah,&#x201d; I said, suddenly wondering just how much trouble I would be in when my parents saw my nose. &#x201c;Actually, I don&#x2019;t live on the mainland. I live the other direction, out on Midway Island.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Midway as in the Battle of Midway?&#x201d; <br>I nodded. <br>His eyebrows went up and he nodded. &#x201c;Very cool. You&#x2019;re lucky.&#x201d; <br> <i>Lucky.</i> <br>If I had a dollar for every time someone called me that, I&#x2019;d be rich, because that&#x2019;s all I heard when I told people about my life. <br>When I told them that I lived on a coral atoll in the middle of the Pacific: <br> <i>Lucky.</i> <br>When I told them that I didn&#x2019;t go to a real school: <br> <i>Lucky.</i> <br>When I told them that I hung out among dolphins and monk seals and nesting albatross: <br> <i>Lucky.</i> <br>For three years, my parents had been research biologists on historic Midway, now a national wildlife refuge, so I lived there too, in the old admiral&#x2019;s home called Midway House. Sure, there were cool things like having my own golf cart and making my own hours for home school and getting to hang out with <i>National Geographic</i> photographers. Plus the fact I knew more about ocean fish and seabirds than most postgraduate researchers. <br>Those things did make me feel lucky. <br>But then there were other things that did not make me feel so lucky. <br>Like having the Internet crap out for days at a time, and not even owning a cell phone because there was no reception, and getting only three television channels, one of which was CNN, none of which were MTV. What&#x2019;s the point of even having television? <br>Not to mention being the only kid among fifty or so adults, which left me no one to talk to except for Facebook friends, and that was only when the Internet worked. <br>Lately it seemed there were a lot more days when my life felt less like luck and way more like suck. <br>I paid Green Mohawk Dude, tipped him a little, and then headed back for AJ&#x2019;s apartment. <br>What saved me from going crazy most of the time was Dad&#x2019;s sister, my aunt Jillian, who lived in Honolulu. AJ, as I called her, had a place right on Waikiki Beach and was a consultant, which meant she got to do all her work from home. She was way younger than Dad, only about thirty, and when I couldn&#x2019;t take the isolation anymore, my parents would throw me on the supply flight returning to Honolulu from Midway and send me to her. And that&#x2019;s where I had been spending the month of June. <br>When I walked in, AJ was on the phone. Her long brown hair was up in a clip and she had a plumeria-laden cover-up on over her red bikini. AJ&#x2019;s eyes widened when she saw my nose, then she gave me a thumbs-up. As soon as she hung up, she came over and grabbed my chin, eyeing my new piercing. &#x201c;Let me see this diamond I paid for.&#x201d; She grinned. &#x201c;Your parents are never going to let you come here again.&#x201d; <br>I tossed my green crocheted purse on the table. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting my suit on.&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>AJ spent every day sitting by the pool with me, although she did try to get me to branch out. She called through the bathroom door: &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t we do the beach today, Robie? We can get a good spot by the Hilton.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Nope.&#x201d; I put on my purple cheetah bikini. &#x201c;Two words. <i>Sand</i> and <i>waves</i>.&#x201d; <br>She laughed. &#x201c;For someone who lives on an island, you are the most ocean-aversive person I&#x2019;ve ever met.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I love the ocean!&#x201d; I protested, as I opened the door. <br>AJ groaned. &#x201c;You just don&#x2019;t like to touch it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Exactly. I just like to look.&#x201d; I pointed at my nose. &#x201c;Plus I have instructions not to go in the water.&#x201d; <br>She shook her head. &#x201c;Finally, your perfect excuse to not get wet.&#x201d; <br>We went down to the pool. Wearing my contented smile, I leaned back on my pool chair and turned on my e-reader to Stephen King&#x2019;s newest, which I was almost done with. There was absolutely nowhere else I would rather be at that moment. &#x201c;Now, this is the life.&#x201d; <br>She asked, &#x201c;So what shall we do tonight?&#x201d; <br>Every evening we headed off to do something, like see a movie or get pedicures at Ala Moana Center. My toes currently sported bright orange polish, rhinestone flowers on both big toes. One night my aunt surprised me by having a friend of hers come and give me cornrows. My dirty-blond hair was almost to my waist, so it took forever. When she finished, I looked in the mirror and tried not to show my shock. With my tan, the cornrows looked a little tacky. And I didn&#x2019;t look anything like myself. But I didn&#x2019;t want to make AJ feel bad, so I lied and said I loved them. My dad would like them, so I planned on keeping them until I got back to Midway, just so he could see. Plus it was kind of fun to walk around, feeling unrecognizable. <br>AJ waited for me to answer about tonight. <br>&#x201c;International Market Place?&#x201d; I suggested. <br>&#x201c;Sure. Cheesecake Factory after?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Definitely.&#x201d; <br>That evening at the International Market Place, a collection of booths and shops selling anything and everything, I found a henna tattoo stand where a pretty Hawaiian lady, dark hair to her waist and three rings in her nose, beckoned to me. <br>I wanted a real tattoo, but my parents were already going to freak over my nose. AJ had signed the permission form only after I promised to take all the blame. That&#x2019;s how deep her coolness went. She had even sprung for the diamond, which, even she admitted, totally rocked. So, given I&#x2019;d already used up my quota of quasi-permanent bodily changes my parents would dislike, I started to look through the book of henna tattoo samples. <br>AJ tapped me on the arm. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to be right over there by those shell planters.&#x201d; <br>The tattoo lady asked, &#x201c;You want your aumakua?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Your ancestral guide. The spirit that protects your ohana. Your family, yeah?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not Hawaiian.&#x201d; <br>The tattoo lady smiled. &#x201c;Mine is the honu.&#x201d; She pointed to a picture of a sea turtle. <br>&#x201c;I love green sea turtles.&#x201d; I sat down on the wooden chair and propped my foot up on a stool. <br>With a little plastic bottle, she squeezed the brown henna out like she was painting, and it tickled my ankle. The henna turtle looked like brown mud when she finished. &#x201c;It will dry, but leave it on, yeah?&#x201d; She handed me a little baggie with a cotton ball inside. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s soaked in lemon juice. Squeeze this on several times and the henna will last longer.&#x201d; <br>I handed her three wrinkled fives and went to find AJ. <br>There was a huge line outside the Cheesecake Factory, but I made my way through the crowd and inside the noisy restaurant where AJ was already at a table. We shared a slice of turtle cheesecake. AJ had just gotten a refill of decaf when her phone rang. <br>She glanced at her phone. &#x201c;Barney.&#x201d; <br>Even I knew Barney was the guy who gave her the most consulting work. AJ always took his calls. &#x201c;Hey, Barn.&#x201d; <br>I leaned down and touched my tattoo. The henna was stiff and felt like it was drying out my skin. <br>Back above the table, AJ&#x2019;s eyes narrowed as she listened for a while. &#x201c;Seriously?&#x201d; She listened a little more and rolled her eyes. &#x201c;No. No, that&#x2019;s fine. I&#x2019;ll come tomorrow.&#x201d; She hung up and put a hand on mine. &#x201c;I am so sorry, Robie. I&#x2019;ve got to go to LA tomorrow.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That sucks.&#x201d; I wasn&#x2019;t looking forward to cutting short my trip and going back to Midway. But I saw her face and added, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only a week short, I was going back next week anyway.&#x201d; I took a sip of my Coke. <br>The waitress brought the bill and AJ got out her reading glasses. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to go back.&#x201d; She leaned forward like she was going to tell me a secret. &#x201c;Bobbi can stay with you.&#x201d; <br>Stifling a groan, I faked a smile. <br>Bobbi was a friend of AJ&#x2019;s who lived on the other side of Oahu. We&#x2019;d been up to see her a couple times at her beach house, which was always messy and full of smelly cats. Bobbi was old, like fifty, and had thick, waist-length dreadlocks and really tan, leathery-looking skin. She didn&#x2019;t believe in bras. Or deodorant. <br>&#x201c;No, that&#x2019;s okay. I can go back to Midway.&#x201d; I paused. &#x201c;Or&nbsp;&#x2026; I could just stay at your place by myself.&#x201d; <br>She started to shake her head and protest, but I cut her off. &#x201c;AJ, I&#x2019;m almost sixteen.&#x201d; <br>AJ huffed out her nose. &#x201c;Robie. You are not almost sixteen. You&#x2019;ve only been fifteen for two months.&#x201d; <br>I shrugged. &#x201c;Still, you have security up the ying-yang at your place, I know my way around&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>She looked at me over the top of her black cat-eye reading glasses. &#x201c;Your parents would kill me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We won&#x2019;t tell them?&#x201d; <br>AJ tapped the pen on the bill for a moment, and then pointed it at me. &#x201c;Only if Bobbi stops in every day after work.&#x201d; <br>Ew. &#x201c;Every other day.&#x201d; <br>Her voice was firm. &#x201c;Every day.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Fine.&#x201d; I held out my hand and we shook. <br>The next morning, after about an hour of instructions, admonitions, and warnings, AJ left for the airport. I was just getting ready for the pool when the phone rang. Bobbi said, &#x201c;Hi, Robie. Jillian fly out yet?&#x201d; <br>Technically not, since she was probably still sitting at the airport. &#x201c;No.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t talk, but can you give her a message for me?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; <br>Bobbi&#x2019;s words were rushed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not gonna be able to stop in like she asked me to. My car died and I have to carpool with a guy from up here.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d; I smiled as I noticed AJ had left me a small fortune&#x2019;s worth of bills on the counter. <br>&#x201c;Can she get someone else to check in on you?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes. Definitely. Don&#x2019;t worry about it.&#x201d; <br>I hung up. I was free for a week. Although I did already miss AJ, I did a little dance. <br>Free! <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2012 by S. A.

It is perhaps the most prestigious and influential book of strategy in the world today. Now, this unique volume brings together the essential versions of Sun Tzu's text, along with illuminating commentaries and auxiliary texts written by distinguished strategists. The translations, by the renowned translator Thomas Cleary, have all been published previously in book form, except for <i>The Silver Sparrow Art of War, </i>which is available here for the first time. This comprehensive collection contains:<br> <i>The Art of War: </i> This edition of Sun Tzu's text includes the classic collection of commentaries by eleven interpreters.<br> <i>Mastering the Art of War: </i>Consisting of essays by two prominent statesmen-generals of Han dynasty China, Zhuge Liang and Liu Ji, this book develops the strategies of Sun Tzu's classic into a complete handbook of organization and leadership. It draws on episodes from Chinese history to show in concrete terms the proper use of Sun Tzu's principles.<br> <i>The Lost Art of War: </i>Written more than one hundred years after Sun Tzu's text, by Sun Bin, a linear descendant of Sun Tzu, this classic of political and military strategy is faithful to the principles of <i>The Art of War</i>, while developing their practical application much further.<br> <i>The Silver Sparrow Art of War: </i> A version of Sun Tzu's <i>Art of War </i> based on a manuscript of the classic text discovered at a Chinese archeological site in China's Shandong Province in 1972, which contains previously unknown fragments.</p><p>Sun Tzu's <i>Art of War</i> just got better. <i>The Illustrated Art of War</i> enlivens Thomas Cleary's complete translation, including commentaries, with full-color reproductions of paintings and statuary from China and Japan. Talk about martial art--these depictions show full battles scenes, the Chinese god of war, weaponry, processions--even an ancient map. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Here is a seminal work on the philosophy of successful leadership that is as applicable to contemporary business as it is to war.

Now that school is over, Wesley needs a summer project. He&#x2019;s learned that each civilization needs a staple food crop, so he decides to sow a garden and start his own &#x2014; civilization, that is. He turns over a plot of earth, and plants begin to grow. They soon tower above him and bear a curious-looking fruit. As Wesley experiments, he finds that the plant will provide food, clothing, shelter, and even recreation. It isn&#x2019;t long before his neighbors and classmates develop more than an idle curiosity about Wesley &#x2014; and exactly how he is spending his summer vacation.</p><p>What do the children you know usually do when school is out for the summer? Go crazy with boredom? Head poolside with friends? Plan a self-sufficient civilization with its own staple food crop? That is precisely how Wesley decides to spend his summer vacation. Wesley is not an ordinary boy: "He alone in his town disliked pizza and soda, alarming his mother and the school nurse. He found professional football stupid. He'd refused to shave half his head, the hairstyle worn by all the other boys, despite his father's bribe of five dollars." It all starts (the civilization, that is) when Wesley overturns a plot of ground in his yard to see what new and unknown seeds might blow into it. Curiously, just one kind of plant grows--an unusual, flowering, fruit-bearing plant that tastes of "peach, strawberry, pumpkin pie, and flavors he had no name for." Soon, Wesley is literally reaping the fruits of his labors--using the fruit rind to make a cup for the juice he squeezes, barbecuing the root tubers, and weaving the bark into a hat to keep off the sun. <p> In Wesley's new world, he no longer needs a watch because he uses a flower stalk as a sundial, dividing the day into 8 segments, one for each of the flower's petals. A new language (based on an 80-letter alphabet) and counting system (based on the number 8) soon follow. Ah, Weslandia. Slowly but surely his once-tormenting classmates become curious. And soon enough, Wesley allows them to help him crush seeds for oil, which "had a tangy scent and served him both as suntan lotion and mosquito repellent." He also invents sports that are less distasteful to him than football--"games rich with strategy and complex scoring systems," and watches patiently as his classmates blunder. Wesley's parents say that he looks happy for the first time in years. And when he returns to school in September? "He had no shortage of friends." Newbery Medal winner and onetime alternate-world creator Paul Fleischman shines in this deadpan-but-hilarious picture book, and illustrator Kevin Hawkes's splendid paintings will delight young readers with the explosion of colorful, comical details. Kids young and old will love the once-outcast hero Wesley and his Robinson Crusoe-style triumphs.

My family members are big fans of his book Legend of Ninja Cowboy Bear, but I wasn't sure how well his sense of humor would translate to board books.

There's Sheep; Bear; Frog; Ladybug; Giraffe; and Crocodile. Much dry humor is conveyed through their facial expressions - in particular, their eyes - and the simplest of gestures. The books cover uncomplicated concepts (sharing and sleep) with short sentences in a bold font.

Sections include: <br><br>� The Power of a Positive You <br><br>� 5 Rules for Keeping Your Attitude at the Right Altitude <br><br>� <strong>More Power To You </strong>bulleted keys to successful thinking in each chapter <br><br>� The Power of Perspective<br><br>Nobody has more of a "can-do" attitude than Joyce Meyer.

She offers a 12-step program to help readers conquer the negativity that naturally plagues the mind, leaving readers free to enjoy life and pursue their goals. Using themes from other books in her ample catalogue--worry, perseverance, managing emotions--Meyer breaks her suggestions into several digestible lists, backed by a "Power Pack" of Bible verses at the end of each chapter. She offers enthusiastic encouragement, but also requires action, here in the form of practice, discipline, and continual meditation on the 12 motivational thoughts. Critics of the positive thinking movement (Meyer obliquely acknowledges a debt to the pioneering Norman Vincent Peale) will continue to find downsides in this book, among them failure to sufficiently acknowledge the pain of suffering and an ignorance of intractable mental illness. Critics of Meyer will say she sounds like an infomercial ("You will see amazing results"). Yet her many fans will continue to appreciate her upbeat attitude and her ability to offer practical tips on the toughest topics. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The other goal is to try new mediums. I started with pencils and paints, moved into creating art electronically, and am currently playing with fabrics and collage. A lot of the vintage fabrics reminded me of my own childhood&#x2014;other readers may get that warm, fuzzy feeling from them as well. Making art for children is a joy, and using it to teach them is a privilege. <br></p><h2>Tall Tall Tree: A Nature Book for Kids About Forest Habitats (A Rhyming Counting Book with STEAM Activities)</h2><p>Complemented by STEM-based activity suggestions, an introduction to the amazing natural world of the giant redwood combines rhymes, gentle artwork and counting prompts that reveal the teeming life that can be found in and around the world&#39;s tallest trees. Simultaneous.</p><p>PreS-Gr 3&#x2014;An engaging, informative book encouraging ecological awareness for young readers. The ecosystem of a giant redwood tree is charmingly presented in this beautifully illustrated counting book that uses rhyme and rhythm based on the numbers one through 10, stanzas, and snippets of facts about animals who actually live in the redwoods. The text emphasizes counting, number recognition, and simple animal facts. Exquisite, highly detailed illustrations in a palette of natural woodland colors and tones complement the text. The pictures have a soft, blurred edge, which makes all the creatures, even the wood rats, seem appealing. The illustrated animals and the text are displayed in large enough format for young readers to easily discern, enabling them to make the connection between the words, numbers, and pictures. End notes add to the value of this title. There is a fact sheet about giant redwoods, another about the animals featured, a pictorial index to additional animals, and several authoritative online resources listed, as well as QR code access. A STEAM activities page has five educational and age-appropriate projects, such as making bark pictures by using the long side of crayons on paper held against a tree. VERDICT An excellent addition to any nonfiction collection, a great classroom tool for STEAM, and a fun read-a-loud at school, in the library, and at home.&#x2014;Gretchen Crowley, formerly at Alexandria City Public Libraries, VA</p><h2>Engaging God&#39;s Word: James</h2><p>The practical book of James says what we believe is demonstrated by how we live.

Begin with the angel who tells Mary that she is God&#x2019;s chosen vessel and follow along until you reach the zillions of stars that paled in comparison to the star that announced the birthplace of the newborn King. Beautifully illustrated and written, this book will be a classic for parents to read to their children every Christmas season.<br><br><b>Sneak peek:</b><br>Mary gently wrapped her son,<br>then rested in the shed.<br>She placed the newborn Savior<br>in a MANGER for his bed.</p><p>In this Christmas abecedary, Bowman and McKinley use sturdy rhymed couplets, accompanied by Biblical quotes and citations, to retell the nativity story both chronologically and alphabetically. On left-hand pages framed by tidy botanical borders, Keay paints large capital letters and the people or events discussed (Joseph takes a hammer to the letter <i>C</i> on an early page); Bowman&#x2019;s rhymes and Bible verses appear opposite (&#x201c;A <i>carpenter</i> named Joseph/ chose Mary for his wife./ The news that Mary told him/ would soon change Joseph&#x2019;s life&#x201d;). Concrete, nativity-specific words (inn, manger, wise men) share space with terms (king, ruler, savior) that emphasize Jesus&#x2019; role: &#x201c;Though he was just a baby,/ he was born to be a <i>king</i>./ Jesus will reign forever,/ and heaven and earth will sing!&#x201d; Doll-like characterizations and a soft pastel palette bolster this soothing introduction to the story of Jesus&#x2019; birth.

Many others have done the same&#x2014;only to lose it all in the end. Every day, we read about successful people in various walks of life who have lost their power and influence. They&#x2019;ve been fired, forced to resign, or shamed out of public life. They no longer have a market for their gifts, and they may even face criminal proceedings. These leaders have lost the trust of their companies, constituents, nations, followers, and families. Many were surprised to discover that their talents alone were not enough to prevent their downfall.<br><br> Why did they fail in the end? Because they lacked the one quality that would have protected their leadership and given them enduring influence. Ironically, this quality is seldom taught to leaders today, either formally or informally. It is the quality of moral force, or <i>character</i>.<br><br> Every human being is a leader over some domain as he or she exercises gifts and influence. That domain might be the halls of government, the boardroom, the classroom, the community, or the home. In <i>The Power of Character in Leadership: How Values, Morals, Ethics, and Principles Affect Leaders</i>, you will discover what character is, what it means to develop moral force, and how to preserve your leadership influence so that it is both effective <i>and </i>enduring.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Myles Munroe (1954&#x2013;2014) was an international motivational speaker, best-selling author, educator, leadership mentor, and consultant for government and business.

But when Sabrina&#x2019;s teacher, Mr. Grumpner, is found dead, dangling in a giant spiderweb, even Daphne&#x2019;s convinced that Ferryport Landing Elementary has a monster problem.

He lives in Montreal, Canada.<br><br> &nbsp;Grade 4-6&#x2013;In this second book in the series, Sabrina and Daphne continue their family's fairy-tale detective work in the Hudson River town of Ferryport Landing. The village has more than its share of Everafters, a group of fairy-tale characters who escaped persecution in Europe by fleeing to America over 200 years ago. Here, the sisters start attending the local elementary school where the principal just happens to be the Pied Piper of Hamelin and Snow White is a most beloved teacher. Almost instantly, one of their teachers is found dead in his classroom, tied to the ceiling in a spider web. While investigating his murder, the girls uncover a devious plot and get closer to discovering the whereabouts of their missing parents. Free-spirited Daphne is a perfect foil for her older, grumpier sister, Sabrina, whose understandable anger over the loss of her parents is the main theme of this novel. There are as many references to frightening aspects of today's world as there are nods to folklore and sometimes both appear in the same sentence. While this mixing of sensibilities proves that fairy tales can be as dark as reality, it also occasionally trivializes truly upsetting modern problems such as nuclear weapons and child labor. The story is fast paced and the main characters are sympathetic and appealing. The abrupt ending will leave readers hungry for the next book in the series.<i>&#x2013;Kathleen Meulen, Blakely Elementary School, Bainbridge Island, WA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He was known as one of the best vehicle escape artists, a tenacious business man, and a ruthless killer. He partied with major stars such as Frank Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe and did business with agents ranging from the CIA to the Vatican to the shah of Iran. When politician Joe Kennedy gave Giancana the chance to use mob muscle to get his son John elected, Giancana jumped at the task. But the Kennedy brothers double-crossed him, waging full-out war on organized crime throughout the United States. And Giancana went after them.<br><br>Written with suspense and conviction, we learn about how the CIA asked Giancana to assassinate Fidel Castro. The book includes Giancana's testimony about the truth of his involvement in the deaths of Monroe and others, among others. Chuck Giancana, Sam's brother, contributes a unique perspective of the mobs relationship with the Bay of Pigs and many other pivotal events of the 60's and beyond. Double Cross is an eye-opening account of the interworking of the government and the mob and how this relationship has impacted American history.</p><p>Sam Giancana is the nephew of the late crime boss Sam Momo&#x201d; Giancana.<br><br>Chuck Giancana, who passed away in 2001, was the brother of the late crime boss Sam Momo&#x201d; Giancana.<br><br>Bettina Giancana is a recognized expert in the organized crime genre.The cottage industry of Kennedy assassination theorists shows no sign of abating, as shown by this story of the much publicized revelations of Chuck Giancana, brother to Chicago Mafia Don Sam Giancana. Jerry Orbach&#39;s tough, full-voiced reading works perfectly to narrate the rise of a two-bit hood to someone who could push the button on J.F.K. and Marilyn Monroe. The story&#39;s denouement is unconvincing, but the tapes are entertaining throughout. The latter part of the story seems to rush by, perhaps indicating the lack of support for Giancana&#39;s claims. After hearing this abridgment, the listener is confident that the complete book holds no &#34;explosive&#34; secrets. M.J.C.

He lives in Denver, Colorado, with his wife and sons.Trouble at the Arcade <b>1</b> <p></p> <b>Alien Attack!</b><p></p> <br>A<i>ll humans will be destroyed!&#x201d;</i> a metallic voice rang out.<br> <br>Nine-year-old Frank Hardy gasped as yet another row of hideous aliens appeared over the horizon. There was no question about it. Earth was being invaded!<br> <br>&#x201c;Ha!&#x201d; he shouted, and his dark hair fell in his eyes as he dodged a laser blast by doing a somersault through the air. Then he ducked around a huge pile of rocks.<br> <br>Oh no! There were more aliens behind the rock pile. And these were even worse. They were spitting horrible blue goo!<br> <br><i>BLURP!</i> A wad of goo came flying at Frank.<br> <br>He jumped up and did a flip in midair to avoid the goo. Then he karate-kicked a rock. It crashed down on one of the aliens.<br> <br><i>SPLAT!</i> Blue goo spurted everywhere.<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;Gotcha!&#x201d; Frank cried.<br> <br>&#x201c;Frank! Are you up there?&#x201d;<br> <br>For a second Frank thought one of the aliens was calling him. Then he realized it wasn&#x2019;t an alien. It was his mother. He blinked and looked up from the video game console.<br> <br><i>BLURP!</i> On the screen, the aliens were still coming. A few seconds later a big blob of goo took over the screen, and then two words appeared:<br> <br>&#x201c;Rats,&#x201d; Frank muttered. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll never be ready for the contest if I don&#x2019;t do better than that.&#x201d;<br> <br>His mother called his name again. He set down the controls and walked out to the top of the stairs to see what she wanted.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, there you are.&#x201d; Mrs. Hardy was holding a large spoon in one hand and a book in the other. She was a librarian, and she almost always had a book with her. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Joe&#x2019;s turn to set the table for dinner,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But I can&#x2019;t find him anywhere. Have you seen him?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nope.&#x201d; Frank started down the stairs. &#x201c;But don&#x2019;t worry. I&#x2019;ll find him.&#x201d;<br> <br>He went out the back door and crossed the lawn, heading toward the woods at the back of the yard. Before he got there, he looked around carefully.<br> <br>There were hedges on both sides of the yard, so none of the neighbors could see him. The sound of hammering was coming from the spare room over the garage. Mr. Hardy had been working up there for weeks during his free time. But Frank couldn&#x2019;t see his father through the window, so he guessed his father couldn&#x2019;t see him, either.<br> <br>Frank ducked into a narrow path between two bushes. It looked like a trail that nothing but a deer or a rabbit would use. But it actually led straight to the tree house Frank and his younger brother Joe had helped their parents build in the woods. No one except the two of them (and their parents) knew the tree house was there.<br> <br>The tree house was halfway up a huge old maple tree. Frank and Joe had painted the bottom of the platform green and brown. That way, even if someone walked right past, they probably wouldn&#x2019;t notice it.<br> <br>At least not most of the time. Right now anyone passing by would definitely see it. That was because Joe had left the ladder hanging down.<br> <br>The ladder was made out of rope and planks. It had a pulley system so the boys could keep it rolled up out of sight whether they were in the tree house or not.<br> <br><br> <br>Frank grabbed the ladder and started to climb. Soon he was peering into the tree house. It was one big room inside. The back wall was the trunk of the tree, and the front wall had the door and a window cut out of it. One of the side walls was covered with posters from martial arts and monster movies, and the other had a dry-erase whiteboard where the brothers could leave notes for each other. There was no real furniture, but there were some cushions to make sitting on the floor more comfortable.<br> <br>Eight-year-old Joe Hardy was sitting on one of the floor cushions, reading comic books. His dirty-blond hair was sticking up in one place like he hadn&#x2019;t brushed it when he&#x2019;d gotten out of bed. &#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; he said when Frank climbed in. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You forgot to pull up the ladder,&#x201d; said Frank. &#x201c;Are you crazy? We don&#x2019;t want Adam to find this place.&#x201d;<br> <br>Adam Ackerman lived on the other side of the woods. He was in Frank&#x2019;s class at school and was known as the meanest bully in Bayport.<br> <br>Joe just shrugged. &#x201c;Well, he didn&#x2019;t find it, did he?&#x201d;<br> <br>Frank frowned. Joe was always saying stuff like that.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom&#x2019;s looking for you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your turn to set the table.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; Joe tossed the comic book he was reading into the messy pile beside him. Then the two boys climbed back down the ladder and used the pulley to lift it back out of sight.<br> <br>&#x201c;What were you doing out here, anyway?&#x201d; Frank asked as they pushed their way out of the woods. &#x201c;You should be practicing for the video game tournament tomorrow. Otherwise you&#x2019;ll never make it past the first round.&#x201d;<br> <br>That was why Frank had been playing Alien Blob Blaster. The tournament was being held at the grand reopening of the arcade at Bayport Fun World. The grand prize was a brand-new superdeluxe game system.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who needs practice when you have natural talent?&#x201d; Joe bragged. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not only planning to make the finals&#x2014;I&#x2019;m planning to win!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be so sure,&#x201d; said Frank. &#x201c;That VidPoint 3000 game is way better than the one we have. Tons of people will be there trying to win it. That&#x2019;s why you need to practice. With both of us entering, we&#x2019;ll have twice the chance of winning.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We?&#x201d; Joe echoed with a grin. &#x201c;Who says I&#x2019;m going to share when I win that game?&#x201d;<br> <br>Frank rolled his eyes. &#x201c;What choice do you have? We share a room, remember?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe not for long.&#x201d; Joe looked toward the garage. The sound of hammering was still coming from that direction. &#x201c;Dad&#x2019;s almost finished fixing up the spare room. And you know what that means!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. What?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Duh!&#x201d; said Joe. &#x201c;It means we&#x2019;ll finally get our own bedrooms!&#x201d;<br> <br>Frank cast a dubious look at the garage. &#x201c;I doubt it,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The spare room is practically a whole separate apartment from the rest of the house. Mom and Dad aren&#x2019;t going to let either of us live out there.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re so sure, I guess that means you don&#x2019;t mind if I&#x2019;m the one who moves out there,&#x201d; Joe said. &#x201c;Cool. You can keep our tiny old room. You can even have both bunk beds all to yourself. I&#x2019;ll just fill up all the space in my brand-new room with my brand-new VidPoint 3000.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Dream on,&#x201d; Frank said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been practicing all week for that contest.

As the two of them drift off to sleep, they dream of sailing the high seas, chasing butterflies, bouncing through cow pastures, creeping through a cave, swinging from a vine, and so on until, soaring through the sky, they return home to cuddle in bed. The richly textured spreads are bright and imaginative, perfectly complementing the simple, lyrical text. Begging to be sung, this will be a natural choice for bedtime or teddy-bear-themed storyhours.&#x2014;<i>Rachel Kamin, North Suburban Synagogue Beth El, Highland Park, IL</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Maxwell, a master communicator and relational expert, makes learning about relationships accessible to everyone. The most sophisticated leaders and salespeople will pick up on skills that will make them even better, and relational novices will learn skills that can transform them into relational dynamos.</p></p><p>John C.

Visit JohnMaxwell.com for more information.With more than seven million copies of 30-odd titles in print, preacher turned leadership guru Maxwell is a one-man publishing empire. His latest follows the proven format&#x2014;a series of short, friendly sermons filled with plainspoken common sense. This time, Maxwell takes on interpersonal skills, saying, "All of life's successes come from initiating relationships with the right people and then strengthening those relationships by using good people skills." The book offers 25 chapter-based "People Principles" that explore how to prepare oneself for relationships, focus on others, build trust, invest in others and create win-win relationships. The quality of the content varies. Some chapters, like "The Confrontation Principle" with its six-step "road map for healthy confrontation," are concise, thoughtful and original. Others (particularly in the later sections, where the book starts to run out of steam), such as "The Partnership Principle," are more like motivational talks and offer few practical takeaways. Each principle is introduced with two to three pages featuring a familiar figure&#x2014;Abraham Lincoln, Barbara Walters, Ben Franklin, Angelina Jolie, etc.&#x2014;or a personal story from the author's life. Maxwell concludes each principle with a page of discussion questions, which should prove useful since the book doesn't lend itself to a cover-to-cover read and is probably best swallowed one principle at a time, with some reflection in between. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Gillingham&#x2019;s clean graphics showcase one child&#x2019;s very evident love of toy trucks; the brown-skinned, overalls-clad child&#x2019;s gender isn&#x2019;t apparent, a reminder that truck love is universal." &#x2013; Publishers Weekly<br><br>"Love IS a truck!

The intensively researched, atmospheric narrative of the lives of the Clutter family of Holcomb, Kansas, and of the two men, Richard Eugene Hickock and Perry Edward Smith, who brutally killed them on the night of November 15, 1959, is the seminal work of the &#x201c;new journalism.&#x201d; Perry Smith is one of the great dark characters of American literature, full of contradictory emotions. &#x201c;I thought he was a very nice gentleman,&#x201d; he says of Herb Clutter. &#x201c;Soft-spoken. I thought so right up to the moment I cut his throat.&#x201d; Told in chapters that alternate between the Clutter household and the approach of Smith and Hickock in their black Chevrolet, then between the investigation of the case and the killers&#x2019; flight, Capote&#x2019;s account is so detailed that the reader comes to feel almost like a participant in the events.</p><p><i>In Cold Blood</i> was a groundbreaking work when released in 1966. With it, author Truman Capote contributed to a style of writing in which the reporter gets so far inside the subject, becomes so familiar, that he projects events and conversations as if he were really there. The style has probably never been accomplished better than in this book. Capote combined painstaking research with a narrative feel to produce one of the most spellbinding stories ever put on the page. Two two-time losers living in a lonely house in western Kansas are out to make the heist of their life, but when things don't go as planned, the robbery turns ugly. From there, the book is a real-life look into murder, prison, and the criminal mind.On November 15, 1959, in the small town of Holcomb, Kansas, four members of the Clutter family were savagely murdered by blasts from a shotgun held a few inches from their faces. There was no apparent motive for the crime, and there were almost no clues. <br>Five years, four months and twenty-nine days later, on April 14, 1965, Richard Eugene Hickock, aged thirty-three, and Perry Edward Smith, aged thirty-six, were hanged from the crime on a gallows in a warehouse in the Kansas State Penitentiary in Lansing, Kansa. <br>In Cold Blood is the story of the lives and deaths of these six people. It has already been hailed as a masterpiece.</p><h2>Weight Watchers New Complete Cookbook, Smartpoints&#x2122; Edition: Over 500 Delicious Recipes for the Healthy Cook's Kitchen</h2><p><b>Weight Watchers</b><b>&nbsp;New Complete Cookbook, 5th Edition, Completely Updated with SmartPoint&#x2122;</b><b>&nbsp;Information!</b><br><br>Weight Watchers� knows the secrets for pairing good nutrition with great taste.

The author, who is a founder of the Insight Meditation Society in Barre, Massachusetts, uses 25 years of teaching experience to shed light on this "incandescent power of love" that is present in all of us. Salzberg talks about the significance of intimacy with ourselves as a prelude to reaching out to others. Some of the hindrances to lovingkindness are enslavement to desire and attachment as well as addiction to anger and aversion. Salzberg affirms equanimity and generosity as keys to developing a compassionate heart.

It's supposed to show where we taste different things, like salty on the side of the tongue, sweet in the front, bitter in the back. Some guy drew it a hundred years ago, and people have been forcing kids to memorize it ever since.<br><br>But it's wrong--all wrong. As in, not even the slightest bit right. It turns out that our taste buds are all alike, they can taste everything, and they're all over the place. Mr. Landau, seventh-grade science teacher, has unrolled a beaten-up poster of the ignorant tongue map, and he's explaining about how people have misunderstood the science of taste since the beginning of time.<br><br>Everyone in my class, even Bob English Who Draws, is paying attention today, because this is the first day of "How We Taste," also known as The Science Unit of Destiny. They all believe that sometime in the next ten school days, at least one person in the room is going to discover his or her own personal fate: true love or tragic death.<br><br>Yes, those are the only two choices.<br>Bob English Who Draws is really named Robert English. Back in fourth grade, our teacher, Ms. Diamatis, started calling him Bob English Who Draws because he was always zoning out and doodling with a superfine Sharpie. Ms. Diamatis would say, "Bob English Who Draws, can you please take us through the eights?" It was her job to make sure no one got out of fourth grade without lightning-fast multiplication skills. And everyone has called him that ever since.<br><br>While the rest of the class is hanging on every syllable that comes out of Mr. Landau's mouth, I'm looking at the false tongue poster and I'm kind of wishing it wasn't wrong. There's something nice about those thick black arrows: sour here, salty there, like there's a right place for everything. Instead of the total confusion the human tongue actually turns out to be.<br>People, People<br><br>It's Friday afternoon, last period. Gym. Ms. Warner and I have done our Friday high five. We do it every week, because I hate school and she hates work, and we both live for Friday.<br><br>We're playing volleyball, with an exclamation point. Ms. Warner has written it on the whiteboard outside the gym doors: Volleyball!<br><br>The combination of seeing that word and breathing the smell of the first floor, which is the smell of the cafeteria after lunch, creates some kind of echo in my head, like a faraway shout.<br><br>In the morning, the cafeteria smells fried and sweet, like fish sticks and cookies. But after lunch, it's different. There's more kid sweat and garbage mixed in, I guess. Or maybe it's just that, after lunch, the cafeteria doesn't have the smell of things to come. It's the smell of what has been.<br><br>Volleyball!<br><br>Ms. Warner is at the net with her hands on her knees, calling stuff out to kids and smiling like crazy. "Shazam!" she yells when Eliza Donan gives the ball a halfhearted bump with her forearm. "Sweet shot!"<br><br>If you didn't know Ms. Warner, you'd think there's no place she'd rather be. Maybe she's trying out my mom's famous theory that if you smile for no reason at all you will actually start to feel happy. Mom's always telling me to smile and hoping I'll turn into a smiley person, which, to be honest, is kind of annoying. But I know she's extra-sensitive about me ever since she and Dad made their big announcement that we had to sell our house. She even recorded a bunch of America's Funniest Home Videos for me to watch: my smile therapy.<br><br>I tell Mom to please save her miracle cures for the hospital. She's a nurse in the intensive-care ward, where she has to check on her patients every fifteen minutes. It's a hard habit to break, I guess, all that checking. I've been watching the shows, though, and they do make me laugh. How can you not laugh at America's Funniest Home Videos? All those wacky animals. All that falling down.<br><br>I count the number of rotations we have left in "Volleyball!" before it's my serve and then glance at the huge clock in its protective cage on the wall. I calculate a fifty-fifty chance that the dismissal bell will save me, but the next thing I know I'm in that back corner, balancing the ball on one palm and getting ready to slap it with the other.<br><br>Don't look at the ball.<br><br>Point your eyes where you want the ball to go.<br><br>But the advice in my head is useless, because time slows down until everyone's voices transform into something that sounds like underwater whale-singing.<br><br>Well, obviously "underwater," I tell myself. Where else are you going to find whales?<br><br>I should be paying attention to the ball.<br><br>Just as I'm about to smack it, I get this feeling, this premonition, that I'm going to land the ball at least somewhere on the other side of the net, maybe even in that big hole in the second row where Mandy and Gabe are being careful not to stand too close because they secretly like each other.<br><br>I'm wrong, though. The ball goes high, falls short, and hits the floor between the feet of Dallas Llewellyn, who is standing right in front of me. My serve is what is called an epic fail, and some of the girls start doing the slow clap.<br><br>Clap.<br><br>Pause.<br><br>Clap.<br><br>Pause.<br><br>Clap.<br><br>It's sarcastic clapping. You know that famous philosophical question "What is the sound of one hand clapping?" Well, I have no idea, but it has to be better than the slow clap.<br><br>Ms. Warner is yelling "People! People!" like she always does when kids are mean and she has no idea what to do about it.<br><br>Dallas hands me the ball for my second try and I hit it right away, just to get it over with. This time it goes way left, out of bounds. Then the bell rings, kids fly in all directions, and the week is over.<br><br></p></p><h2>Who Was Johnny Appleseed?</h2><p>The perfect biography to "bite into" at the start of a new school year!

Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.In 1845 Henry David Thoreau left his pencil-manufacturing business and began building a cabin on the shore of Walden Pond near Concord, Massachusetts. This lyrical yet practical-minded book is at once a record of the 26 months Thoreau spent in withdrawal from society -- an account of the daily minutiae of building, planting, hunting, cooking, and, always, observing nature -- and a declaration of independence from the oppressive mores of the world he left behind. Elegant, witty, and quietly searching, Walden remains the most persuasive American argument for simplicity of life clarity of conscience.<br><br>For the first time, the authoritative editions of works by major American novelists, poets, scholars, and essayists collected in the hardcover volumes of The Library of America are being published singly in a series of handsome paperback books. A distinguished writer has contributed an introduction for each volume, which also includes a chronology of the author's life and career, an essay on the text, and notes.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Feminist Baby!

He&#x2019;s been hoarding vast stockpiles of his namesake metal, and it&#x2019;s attracted the suspicion of 007&#x2019;s superiors at MI6. Sent to investigate, Bond uncovers an ingenious gold-smuggling scheme, as well as Goldfinger&#x2019;s most daring caper yet: Operation Grand Slam, a gold heist so audacious it could bring down the world economy and put the fate of the West in the hands of SMERSH. To stop Goldfinger, Bond will have to survive a showdown with the sinister millionaire&#x2019;s henchman, Oddjob, a tenacious karate master who can kill with one well-aimed toss of his razor-rimmed bowler hat.</p><p><b>The text in this edition has been restored by the Fleming family company Ian Fleming Publications, to reflect the work as it was originally published.</b></p><p><b>www.ianfleming.com </b></p></p><p>Ian Fleming was born in London on May 28, 1908. He was educated at Eton College and later spent a formative period studying languages in Europe. His first job was with Reuters News Agency where a Moscow posting gave him firsthand experience with what would become his literary <i>bete noire</i>&#x2014;the Soviet Union. During World War II he served as Assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence and played a key role in Allied espionage operations. <p>After the war he worked as foreign manager of the <i>Sunday Times</i>, a job that allowed him to spend two months each year in Jamaica. Here, in 1952, at his home &#x201c;Goldeneye,&#x201d; he wrote a book called <i>Casino Royale</i>&#x2014;and James Bond was born. The first print run sold out within a month. For the next twelve years Fleming produced a novel a year featuring Special Agent 007, the most famous spy of the century. His travels, interests, and wartime experience lent authority to everything he wrote. Raymond Chandler described him as &#x201c;the most forceful and driving writer of thrillers in England.&#x201d; Sales soared when President Kennedy named the fifth title, <i>From Russia With Love</i>, one of his favorite books.

REFLECTIONS IN A DOUBLE BOURBON</b> <p>James Bond, with two double bourbons inside him, sat in the final departure lounge of Miami Airport and thought about life and death.</p> <p>It was part of his profession to kill people. He had never liked doing it and when he had to kill he did it as well as he knew how and forgot about it. As a secret agent who held the rare double-0 prefix&#x2014;the licence to kill in the Secret Service - it was his duty to be as cool about death as a surgeon. If it happened, it happened. Regret was unprofessional&#x2014;worse, it was death watch beetle in the soul.</p> <p>And yet there had been something curiously impressive about the death of the Mexican. It wasn't that he hadn't deserved to die. He was an evil man, a man they call in Mexico a capungo. A capungo is a bandit who will kill for as little as forty pesos, which is about twenty-five shillings&#x2014;though probably he had been paid more to attempt the killing of Bond&#x2014;and, from the look of him, he had been an instrument of pain and misery all his life. Yes, it had certainly been time for him to die; but when Bond had killed him, less than twenty-four hours before, life had gone out of the body so quickly, so utterly, that Bond had almost seen it come out of his mouth as it does, in the shape of a bird, in Haitian primitives.</p> <p>What an extraordinary difference there was between a body full of person and a body that was empty! Now there is someone, now there is no one. This had been a Mexican with a name and an address, an employment card and perhaps a driving licence. Then something had gone out of him, out of the envelope of flesh and cheap clothes, and had left him an empty paper bag waiting for the dustcart. And the difference, the thing that had gone out of the stinking Mexican bandit, was greater than all Mexico.</p> <p>Bond looked down at the weapon that had done it. The cutting edge of his right hand was red and swollen. It would soon show a bruise. Bond flexed the hand, kneading it with his left. He had been doing the same thing at intervals through the quick plane trip that had got him away. It was a painful process, but if he kept the circulation moving the hand would heal more quickly. One couldn't tell how soon the weapon would be needed again. Cynicism gathered at the corners of Bond's mouth.</p> <p>'National Airlines, Airline of the Stars', announces the departure of their flight NA 106 to La Guardia Field, New York. Will all passengers please proceed to gate number seven. All aboard, please.'</p> <p>The Tannoy switched off with an echoing click. Bond glanced at his watch. At least another ten minutes before Transamerica would be called. He signalled to a waitress and ordered another double bourbon on the rocks. When the wide, chunky glass came, he swirled the liquor round for the ice to blunt it down and swallowed half of it. He stubbed out the butt of his cigarette and sat, his chin resting on his left hand, and gazed moodily across the twinkling tarmac to where the last half of the sun was slipping gloriously into the Gulf.</p> <p>The death of the Mexican had been the finishing touch to a bad assignment, one of the worst&#x2014;squalid, dangerous and without any redeeming feature except that it had got him away from headquarters.</p> <p>A big man in Mexico had some poppy fields. The flowers were not for decoration. They were broken down for opium, which was sold quickly and comparatively cheaply by the waiters at a small cafe in Mexico City called the 'Madre de Cacao'. The Madre de Cacao had plenty of protection. If you needed opium you walked in and ordered what you wanted with your drink. You paid for your drink at the caisse and the man at the caisse told you how many noughts to add to your bill. It was an orderly commerce of no concern to anyone outside Mexico. Then, far away in England, the Government, urged on by the United Nations' drive against drug smuggling, announced that heroin would be banned in Britain. There was alarm in Soho and also among respectable doctors who wanted to save their patients agony. Prohibition is the trigger of crime. Very soon the routine smuggling channels from China, Turkey and Italy were run almost dry by the illicit stockpiling in England. In Mexico City, a pleasant-spoken Import and Export merchant called Blackwell had a sister in England who was a heroin addict. He loved her and was sorry for her and, when she wrote that she would die if someone didn't help, he believed that she wrote the truth and set about investigating the illicit dope traffic in Mexico. In due course, through friends and friends of friends, he got to the Madre de Cacao and on from there to the big Mexican grower. In the process, he came to know about the economics of the trade, and he decided that if he could make a fortune and at the same time help suffering humanity he had found the Secret of Life. Blackwell's business was in fertilisers. He had a warehouse and a small plant and a staff of three for soil testing and plant research. It was easy to persuade the big Mexican that, behind this respectable front, Blackwell's team could busy itself extracting heroin from opium. Carriage to England was swiftly arranged by the Mexican. For the equivalent of a thousand pounds a trip, every month one of the diplomatic couriers of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs carried an extra suitcase to London. The price was reasonable. The contents of the suitcase, after the Mexican had deposited it at the Victoria Station left-luggage office and had mailed the ticket to a man called Schwab, c/o Boox-an-Pix, Ltd, WCI, were worth twenty thousand pounds.</p> <p>Unfortunately Schwab was a bad man, unconcerned with suffering humanity. He had the idea that if American juvenile delinquents could consume millions of dollars' worth of heroin every year, so could their Teddy boy and girl cousins. In two rooms in Pimlico, his staff watered the heroin with stomach powder and sent it on its way to the dance halls and amusement arcades.</p> <p>Schwab had already made a fortune when the CID Ghost Squad got on to him. Scotland Yard decided to let him make a little more money while they investigated the source of his supply. They put a close tail on Schwab and in due course were led to Victoria Station and thence to the Mexican courier. At that stage, since a foreign country was concerned, the Secret Service had had to be called in and Bond was ordered to find out where the courier got his supplies and to destroy the channel at source.</p> <p>Bond did as he was told. He flew to Mexico City and quickly got to the Madre de Cacao. Thence, posing as a buyer for the London traffic, he got back to the big Mexican. The Mexican received him amiably and referred him to Blackwell. Bond had rather taken to Blackwell. He knew nothing about Blackwell's sister, but the man was obviously an amateur and his bitterness about the heroin ban in England rang true. Bond broke into his warehouse one night and left a thermite bomb. He then went and sat in a cafe a mile away and watched the flames leap above the horizon of rooftops and listened to the silver cascade of the fire-brigade bells. The next morning he telephoned Blackwell. He stretched a handkerchief across the mouthpiece and spoke through it.</p> <p>' Sorry you lost your business last night. I'm afraid your insurance won't cover those stocks of soil you were researching.'</p> <p>'Who's that? Who's speaking?' 'I'm from England. That stuff of yours has killed quite a lot of young people over there. Damaged a lot of others. Santos won't be coming to England any more with his diplomatic bag. Schwab will be in jail by tonight. That fellow Bond you've been seeing, he won't get out of the net either. The police are after him now.'</p> <p>Frightened words came back down the line.</p> <p>'All right, but just don't do it again. Stick to fertilisers.'</p> <p>Bond hung up.</p> <p>Blackwell wouldn't have had the wits. It was obviously the big Mexican who had seen through the false trail. Bond had taken the precaution to move his hotel, but that night, as he walked home after a last drink at the Copacabana, a man suddenly stood in his way. The man wore a dirty white linen suit and a chauffeur's white cap that was too big for his head. There were deep blue shadows under Aztec cheekbones. In one corner of the slash of a mouth there was a toothpick and in the other a cigarette. The eyes were bright pin-pricks of marihuana.</p> <p>'You like woman? Make jigajig?'</p> <p>'No.'</p> <p>'Coloured girl? Fine jungle tail?'</p> <p>&#x2018;No.'</p> <p>'Mebbe pictures?'</p> <p>The gesture of the hand slipping into the coat was so well known to Bond, so full of old dangers that when the hand flashed out and the long silver finger went for his throat. Bond was on balance and ready for it.</p> <p>Almost automatically, Bond went into the 'Parry Defence against Underhand Thrust' out of the book. His right arm cut across, his body swivelling with it. The two forearms met mid-way between the two bodies, banging the Mexican's knife arm off target and opening his guard for a crashing short-arm chin jab with Bond's left. Bond's stiff, locked wrist had not travelled far, perhaps two feet, but the heel of his palm, with fingers spread for rigidity, had come up and under the man's chin with terrific force. The blow almost lifted the man off the sidewalk. Perhaps it had been that blow that had killed the Mexican, broken his neck, but as he staggered back on his way to the ground, Bond had drawn back his right hand and slashed sideways at the taut, offered throat. It was the deadly hand-edge blow to the Adam's apple, delivered with the fingers locked into a blade, that had been the standby of the Commandos. If the Mexican was still alive, he was certainly dead before he hit the ground.</p> <p>Bond stood for a moment, his chest heaving, and looked at the crumpled pile of cheap clothes flung down in the dust. He glanced up and down the street. There was no one. Some cars passed. Others had perhaps passed during the fight, but it had been in the shadows. Bond knelt down beside the body. There was no pu...</p></p><h2>Colorado Road &amp; Recreation Atlas (Benchmark Recreation Atlases)</h2><p><b>All New Landscape MapsTM</b><br> -Over 2,300 miles newly field-checked, reaching 29 Counties and all national parks &amp; forests, resulting in 400+ edits to recreation &amp; camping POI.<br> -Landscape Maps now include GMU boundaries<br> -National Forest private in-holdings are shown<br> <p> <b>Recreation Guide</b><br> -Public Lands maps are completely updated with point-to-point mileages and attractions.<br> -Recreation Guide fact-checked &amp; updated<br> </p><li>Parks, Monuments, Natural Wonders</li><br> <li>Campgrounds &amp; RV Parks</li><br> <li>Boating &amp; Fishing Access</li><br> <li>Forest &amp; Wildlife Areas</li><br> <li>Mountain Recreation guide shows all of Colorado s 14ers and ski areas.</li><br> <p> Benchmark s Colorado Road &amp; Recreation Atlas is designed to help residents and visitors make the most of Colorado s endless recreation opportunities.

With each turn of the page, readers reveal Little Green Monster's little yellow eyes, his little red mouth, and even a cute, tiny white monster tooth. Then, when the stars begin to appear, it's time for bed... so, nighty night, little yellow eyes. Nighty night, little red mouth. Nighty night, cute little white tooth.

You can visit him online at www.edemberley.com.PreS-Children will be starstruck with this monstrously interactive bedtime story. Die-cut shapes on every spread reveal Little Green Monster's physical features: his yellow eyes, bluish-greenish squiggly ears, curly purple hair, etc. Words that describe a feature of the little monster (e.g., "bluish-green nose" and "red smiley mouth with one tiny white tooth") are printed in the corresponding colors. As the story progresses, cut-out stars start to appear, representing bedtime. Colorful words and die-cut-shaped features of the monster are then repeated as readers say "nighty night" to Little Green Monster. Hologram stars, along with a half-moon, fill the final page. Although visually appealing and interactive for toddlers, the die-cut shapes will most likely be vulnerable to wear and tear in most libraries.

Recapitulating that theme is Blake's story of the 1,151-mile Iditarod from Anchorage to Nome; Mick's lead dog is Akiak, who pounds through wind and across snow, never getting lost. Then, on Day Four, ice jams up one of Akiak's pawpads and she is taken out of the race and almost flown home. She twists free of her handler before the plane takes off, pushes through blizzards and past checkpoints, sticking to the trail and eventually meeting up with Mick; according to the rules, Akiak cannot be harnessed up again but she does prevent her mistress from taking the wrong trail before climbing aboard the sled for the ride to a first-place finish. Blake's naturalistic icy blue paintings chronicle Akiak's independent race across lone landscapes, burrowing in snowdrifts for shelter and escaping well-meaning trail volunteers. The rugged style translates well from the ocean setting of Spray (1996) to the untamed Alaskan terrain; the textured slathers of oil paint in repeated cold tones are perfect for icy plains, tracks in the snow, and rooftop icicles. Akiak's efforts may not constitute life-and-death drama, but young readers will cheer the heroic dog on in this satisfying outdoor adventure.

The audio program provides clear models (both male and female) to help coach a standard American accent.<br> The program is designed to help users speak Standard American English with clarity, confidence, and accuracy. The many exercises in the book concentrate on topics such as vowel sounds, problematic consonants such as V, W, TH, the American R and T and others. Correct lip and tongue positions for all sounds are discussed in detail.<br> Beyond the production of sounds, the program provides detailed instruction in prosodic elements such as syllable stress, emphasis, intonation, linking words for smoother speech flow, common word contractions, and much more.<br> Additional topics that often confuse ESL students are also discussed and explained. They include distinguishing between casual and formal speech, homophones (e.g., they're and there), recognizing words with silent letters (e.g., comb, receipt), and avoiding embarrassing pronunciation mistakes, such as mixing up "pull" and "pool."<br> Students are familiarized with many irregular English spelling rules and exceptions, and are shown how such irregularities can contribute to pronunciation errors.

Such series often provide questions with little guidance, leaving students to their own devices. They thus tend to overlook the role of teaching in the church. By contrast, Knowing the Bible avoids the problem by providing substantial instruction with the questions. Knowing the Bible then goes even further by showing how any given passage connects with the gospel, the whole Bible, and Christian theology. I heartily endorse this orientation of individual books to the whole Bible and the gospel, and I applaud the demonstration that sound theology was not something invented later by Christians, but is right there in the pages of Scripture.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Graeme Goldsworthy,</strong>&nbsp;Former Lecturer in Old Testament, Biblical Theology, and Hermeneutics, Moore Theological College</p><p>&#x201c;What a gift to earnest, Bible-loving, Bible-searching believers!

What potential growth in depth and breadth of understanding these studies offer. One can only pray that vast numbers of believers will discover more of God and the beauty of his Word through these rich studies.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Bruce A. Ware,</strong>&nbsp;T.

Simpson&#x2019;s own words!</b></p><p>On July 31, 2007 Federal Court Judge A. Jay Cristol awarded the Goldman family the rights to&nbsp;<i>If I Did It.&nbsp;</i>Thus began one of the strangest odysseys in publishing history.</p><p>The book, called &#x201c;one of the most chilling things I have ever read&#x201d; by Barbara Walters, skyrocketed up bestseller lists across the country in fall 2007 as the national media relentlessly covered O.J. Simpson&#x2019;s dramatic Las Vegas arrest for armed robbery and kidnapping.</p><p>Originally written by O.J. Simpson, this edition includes essays by the Goldmans and a member of the Goldman family legal team that reveal the fascinating story behind the bankruptcy case, the book&#x2019;s publication and the looming court proceedings, that would eventually lead to his conviction.</p><p>In 1994, Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson were brutally murdered at her home in Brentwood, California. O.J. Simpson was tried for the crime in a case that captured the attention of the American people, but was ultimately acquitted of criminal charges. The victims' families brought a civil case against Simpson, which found him liable for willfully and wrongfully causing the deaths of Ron and Nicole committing battery with malice and oppression. In 2006, HarperCollins announced the publication of a book in which O.J. Simpson told how he hypothetically would have committed the murders. In response to public outrage that Simpson stood to profit from these crimes, HarperCollins canceled the book.</p><p>The Goldman family views the book as his confession, and has worked hard to ensure that the public will read this book and learn the truth. This is O.J. Simpson's original manuscript, approved by him, with up to 14,000 words of additional key commentary.</p></p><p>Fred and Kim Goldman are the father and sister of Ron Goldman, who was brutally murdered along with Nicole Brown Simpson in Brentwood, CA on June 12th, 1994. Although O.J. Simpson was acquitted by a jury in the criminal case, he was found responsible for the crimes in a civil case which awarded the Goldmans a judgment of $19 million.With an audacity that vilifies O.J. Simpson more than any other author could, Simpson himself provides a fictional tell-all account of the murders of Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown. Simpson seems to be more concerned about how the press poorly portrayed the facts&#x2014;not about his murderous acts but of his personal life and relationship with Nicole. When he's not lamenting about how he is misunderstood, he's playing arm-chair therapist for Nicole (claiming she was involved with drugs, constantly erratic and still hopelessly longing for him). Simpson insists it was Nicole's actions that ultimately forced him to murder her. With an exclusive commentary read by Kim Goldman (Ron Goldman's sister), an account of writing the book with Simpson by ghostwriter Pablo F. Fenjves and an afterword by Dominick Dunne, listeners get an interesting balancing act of interests and motives for the publication of this story. G. Valmont Thomas eerily embraces Simpson's sound and speech patterns, making the audiobook more disturbing than the book. Hearing Simpson's words at his most enraged, listeners will be impressed and possibly frightened with how well Thomas delivers this first-person narrative. <i>A Beaufort Books hardcover.

Perched above the Sunset Strip like a fairytale castle, the Chateau seems to come from another world entirely. An apartment building-turned-hotel, it has been the backdrop for generations of gossip and folklore: director Nicholas Ray slept with his sixteen-year-old <i>Rebel Without a Cause</i> star Natalie Wood; Jim Morrison swung from the balconies; John Belushi suffered a fatal overdose; and Lindsay Lohan got the boot after racking up nearly $50,000 in charges in less than two months. Much of what's happened inside the Chateau's walls has eluded the public eye--until now. With wit and insight, Shawn Levy recounts the wild revelries and scandalous liaisons, the creative breakthroughs and marital breakdowns, the births and deaths to which the hotel has been a party.</p><p>SHAWN LEVY is the former film critic of <i>The Oregonian </i>and KGW-TV. His writing has appeared in <i>Sight and Sound</i>,<i> Film Comment</i>,<i> American Film</i>,<i> The New York Times</i>, the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>,<i> The Guardian</i>,<i> The Hollywood Reporter</i>,<i> </i>and <i>The Black Rock Beacon</i>.

He jumps and claps and sings for victory in Portland, Oregon.<b>Introduction</b><br><br> They say that Los Angeles doesn&#x2019;t treasure its past.<br><br> How, then, to explain Chateau Marmont?<br><br> For nearly ninety years, as a city and a world changed utterly around it, this unique building, perched above a famous road in West Hollywood, has stood steadily as an oasis of quiet, gentility, privacy, and bohemian charm, a clubhouse for people too rich and famous to belong to clubs, a bolt-hole, a trysting place, a recovery room, a hideaway, an opium den, an atelier, a last resort.<br><br> A snow-white fairy castle with slate-gray roofs, a dozen or so gables, and a dominating turret, it sits on a hill overlooking one of Southern California&#x2019;s busiest and most famous streets and has appeared, from the day it opened, as if it came from another world entirely. &#x201c;The Chateau is a fluke, a marvelous fluke,&#x201d; according to the architecture critic Edgardo Contini. &#x201c;In the midst of endless low-rise, it is a striking high-rise, like a cathe�dral in a medieval town.&#x201d; And its singular appearance houses an equally singular history.<br><br> From Greta Garbo to Howard Hughes, Bette Davis to Mari�lyn Monroe, Jim Morrison to Tony Randall, Johnny Depp to Lindsay Lohan, Chateau Marmont has drawn the most icono�clastic and outlandish personalities from the worlds of film, music, and other creative arts. It has been the site of wild parties and scandalous liaisons, of creative breakthroughs and marital breakdowns, of one-night stands and days-long parties, of famous triumphs and untimely deaths.<br><br> It was built with a mind toward luxury, status, permanence; it became known for privacy, discretion, transience. It began as a dream of high living, settled into a steady hum of quiet gentility, then slipped into something more like practical value, gradually devolving into shabbiness, nearly becoming a dive, its arc mirror�ing the rise, plateau, and fall of the neighborhood in which it sat. But the Chateau never lost its place near the heart of the cultural story of the day, even as the tenor of that day changed again and again. And in the twenty-first century, when, by the arithmetic of Hollywood, it ought to have become anathema simply by virtue of its age, it turned out to be more robust than ever, chic and glamorous and glowing as never before, lifting its environs along with it into a prosperous new era.<br><br> People from all walks of life have found in Chateau Mar�mont a place to get their bearings while navigating the unfath�omable depths of Los Angeles or, in particular, the shark-infested shallows of Hollywood. And people who know those waters well have relied on the Chateau as a patch of dry land&#x2014;private, quiet, undemanding, even serene&#x2014;where they could recuper�ate, revive, create, cavort, or otherwise behave in ways that they wouldn&#x2019;t necessarily at home.<br><br> Over the years, the Chateau has responded to this need for restorative isolation with tolerance and comfort, provided by a staff that could be relied upon to say nothing of what went on before their eyes or under their noses. &#x201c;You can have a very, um, elaborate social life there, if you like,&#x201d; said the actress Geraldine Fitzgerald, &#x201c;or you can live the nun&#x2019;s life, very monastic.&#x201d; Or, as another frequent visitor put it, &#x201c;Just check in at the desk, and nobody ever need see you again. You could <i>die</i> here if you wanted, and they wouldn&#x2019;t always be bothering you, sticking notes under your door.&#x201d;<br><br> Hollywood has hotels that are more luxurious, handsome, exclusive, and prestigious, with bigger rooms and grounds, with finer restaurants, with shops and tennis courts and day spas and nightclubs and VIP services and other amenities. But it has only one Chateau Marmont, its castle on a hill, guarding secrets since before movies could talk or Sunset Boulevard was completely paved.<br><br> *<br><br> The Chateau has spent nearly a century perched on the east�ern edge of the Sunset Strip like the Rock of Gibraltar, a landmark defining a transition, a way station giving harbor to vagabonds, a milestone, a sentinel, a keep. For all that, the building long man�aged a kind of anonymity. Everyone has heard about it; every�one knows it on sight; everyone has trafficked rumors about it; and everyone who is anyone has at one time or another visited it. But until John Belushi&#x2019;s tabloid-feeding death-by-misadventure on the premises, more than fifty years after the hotel opened, relatively few Los Angeles residents outside the world of show business could say exactly where the Chateau was or precisely name the castle-like edifice on the hillside where Sunset Bou�levard melts into the Sunset Strip. People who commuted past it daily for years recognized it and knew it was . . . a mansion, maybe, or a dormitory, or something to do with the movies or Scientology or some cult. It was an architectural curiosity even in a town where the vernacular building style was as coherent as a salad bar, seemingly parachuted into the most modern of streets from some other place and time. It barely announced its pres�ence, sporting a minimal sign that passersby might even mistake as pointing to some other building. It didn&#x2019;t advertise. It simply was. All of which made it, to a certain way of viewing luxury, privacy, celebrity, and Hollywood . . . perfect: a place of secrets standing right out in the open, hidden in plain sight like Poe&#x2019;s purloined letter.<br><br> Perhaps that&#x2019;s why it has been such a magnet for legends, whispers, half-truths, gossip, suspicion. The stories that center on the Marmont&#x2014;real and fictitious&#x2014;span generations: Greta Garbo owned the place in secret (not true); Jean Harlow took lovers while resident with husband number three not long after the suicide of husband number <i>two </i>(pretty much true); How�ard Hughes leased a suite simply to spy on the flesh available at poolside (true-true); F. Scott Fitzgerald suffered a heart attack there during a midday tryst (not true); Vivien Leigh mourned the end of her marriage to Laurence Olivier in a suite plastered with photos of him (true); Rock Hudson met his first live-in lover there, the nephew of the hotel manager (not true); James Dean met <i>Rebel Without a Cause </i>director Nicholas Ray by entering his bungalow via the window rather than the door (not quite); Anthony Perkins used the phone booth in the lobby because he didn&#x2019;t want the switchboard operator to listen in on his personal calls (sadly true); Jim Morrison climbed the ornate balconies and rooftops in drug-fueled antics (mostly, sorta); Led Zeppelin rode motorcycles through the lobby (nuh-uh); Scarlett Johansson and Benicio Del Toro hooked up <i>in the elevator </i>on Oscar night (Who can say?); Lindsay Lohan got the boot after racking up&#x2014;and fail�ing to pay&#x2014;nearly $50,000 in charges in less than two months (all too true); and so on.<br><br> Over the decades, the chance to steep in the atmosphere that generated these stories, apocryphal or not, has drawn visitors as reliably as any advertising campaign ever could. Chateau Mar�mont is the ultimate Hollywood hotel because it is, like Holly�wood itself, bigger than life even when it is obviously fake.<br><br> *<br> &nbsp;<br> The story of Chateau Marmont parallels the story of Hollywood so thoroughly as to be inseparable from it: the silent era, the golden age of the studios, the rise of television, the influx of foreign cinema, the rebel heyday of the sixties and seventies, the blockbuster era, the indie movie upsurge, and the current mingling of film and digital media. At desks in various of its suites and bungalows, Hollywood screenwriters have produced scripts for films as diverse as <i>The Music Man</i>, <i>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</i>, <i>The Day of the Locust</i>, <i>The Color Purple</i>, and <i>Wild Palms</i>. And at least one cinematic masterpiece and cultural landmark&#x2014;Nicholas Ray&#x2019;s <i>Rebel Without a Cause</i>&#x2014;might not have been made at all if its creators hadn&#x2019;t had the Chateau as a laboratory and workshop. Likewise, the chronology of the music business, from the era of the big bands and crooners to the many generations of rock and pop and hip-hop, has been tied to the hotel&#x2019;s history. Key figures from every era have slept, worked, and partied there, from Duke Ellington to Miles Davis to the Velvet Underground to Carly Simon to Rick James to Bono, and many of them have composed material at the hotel that they went on to record and release. So too painters, photographers, fashion designers, advertising executives: Sometimes they have created works of genius while in residence, sometimes flops. In some cases they&#x2019;ve checked into the place to indulge in clandestine appetites, in some to escape persecution, in some because their homes were no longer open to them, in some because they needed a home away from home while they tried to get themselves&#x2014;or their careers&#x2014;back together, in some because great opportuni�ties were spread out before them in the Southern California sun.<br><br> But the story of Chateau Marmont is even more than the story of a century of popular creativity. It is also the story of a very specific place, namely Hollywood and, even more precisely, the Sunset Strip. When the Chateau opened in 1929, the Strip was a dream, with only a few low-slung buildings dotting a rut�ted dirt road that connected the edges of Los Angeles and Bev�erly Hills. As the Strip added paving and showbiz agencies and swank nightspots, the Chateau became known as a reliably quiet and comfortable place for out-of-towners who didn&#x2019;t want to suc�cumb to the glitz and tinsel of the movie colony, as Hollywood was called. After World War II, when the Strip became a haunt of rebels and teens and the fashionably countercultural, so did the Chateau, opening its doors to all&#x2014;straight, gay, sober, addled, black, white, from all walks of life, at reasonable prices, making up with discretion and tolerance what it might have lacked in luxurious touches. When the Strip exploded in unrest in the six�ties, and, soon after, when the action along it slowed, the Chateau entered a period of decline, finding rescue in an owner who fell in love with it and kept it alive when the idea of demolishing it altogether seemed tenable. And then a visionary came along, seeing in the Chateau and the surrounding Strip undervalued assets that, with patient restoration and a certain sense of style and, yes, some sizable investment, could bloom again into some�thing glamorous, chic, and exclusive&#x2014;more so, indeed, than at any time in their existence. Other Hollywood hotels have great claims to history: the Beverly Hills, the Beverly Wilshire, the Hollywood Roosevelt, the Beverly Hilton, and the Bel-Air, as well as such bygone icons as the Garden of Allah and the Ambas�sador. But among them all, Chateau Marmont has most perfectly mirrored its setting, and its setting has long been one of the shin�ing mirrors of the culture of the entire world.<br><br> The tale of Chateau Marmont is a tale of investment and risk, bum luck, and great good fortune, visionaries and myopics, capitalists and laborers, celebrities and hangers-on, aspirants and has-beens, creators and sybarites, those who made and those who took&#x2014;the gamut of a century&#x2019;s worth of American dream�ers, schemers, and strivers within the parameters of a few acres. It&#x2019;s the story of the rise of Los Angeles and a roiling history of show business, a real estate saga and a string of simple human vignettes, a scrapbook of headlines and a junk heap of curiosities.<br><br> *<br><br> Everyone who has ever checked in to Chateau Marmont has had one thing in common: He or she has become part of the vital pulse of an inanimate object that hasn&#x2019;t aged&#x2014;indeed, has gotten <i>more</i> vibrant&#x2014;even as everyone attached to it has grown old or passed away. The lifeblood of a hotel is the people who have stayed in it, who have worked in it, who have used it as a base from which to satisfy private desires or to pursue great pub�lic acclaim. Actors and writers, musicians and deal makers, desk clerks and maids and parking valets and waiters, the stars and the investors and the people who&#x2019;ve not been inside the walls but have always wished they could be: They live and they die as they pass through Chateau Marmont, and the Chateau gives them all what they need from it when their needs arise, a never-ending source of shelter, privacy, convenience, and stability for wander�ers, speculators, and visionaries.<br><br> The Chateau has managed all this despite being small&#x2014;only sixty-three rooms, including its (in)famous bungalows, at its cur�rent largest&#x2014;and despite not providing, for most of its existence, some of the primary amenities expected of a swank hostelry: a restaurant, a bar, shops, salons, a spa, fitness facilities, a full-scale room service operation, even a swimming pool&#x2014;they only dug one after World War II. To some, the lack of these tokens of lux�ury living made the Marmont seem d�class� and undesirable. But through another lens, these absences gave the place a special air: It seemed like a residence and not a way station, like an old European pensione and not some jazzed-up American mega-resort. The lack of high-end amenities in what was otherwise a high-end hotel was a quirk&#x2014;and a litmus test: If you needed to be surrounded by the trappings of wealth, you went elsewhere; if you were a little more self-contained, low-key, modest, Chateau Marmont suited you just fine. &#x201c;The Chateau is the only cheap hotel here that one can stay in and people don&#x2019;t say, &#x2018;Poor guy, he&#x2019;s broke,&#x2019; you know?&#x201d; explained playwright Burt Shevelove, a regular guest of the place. &#x201c;And because of this you meet friends, stage people from New York. There&#x2019;s a tendency to think that if an actor is staying here, he must be quite good.&#x201d;<br><br> The combination of high-profile location and modest appoint�ments meant that the Marmont occupied a special place in Hol�lywood&#x2019;s geography. On the one hand, if you stayed there you were really in the middle of everything. On the other, you <i>had</i> to be near so much because your hotel offered (relative to its deluxe competitors) so little. For the pampered and status con�scious, Chateau Marmont, however charming and central, was a no-go. Which, of course, made it perfect for other sorts. Among the hundreds of famous names that have been entered into the hotel&#x2019;s guest registry, many belonged to Europeans (especially Britons) who don&#x2019;t necessarily expect every hotel to be an all-inclusive resort. Many as well have belonged to creative artists lured to Hollywood to work but determined not to <i>go </i>Hollywood. For decades, the hotel&#x2019;s shabby-chic furnishings and creature <i>dis�</i>comforts gave them the sense of resisting the sirens&#x2019; call . . . even as they cozied right up to the sirens&#x2019; rocky outpost and made a nest for themselves. It was, ironically, an icon for iconoclasts, a comfortable hideaway that you stayed in to prove that you didn&#x2019;t care about comfort, a spot famous for being obscure, treasured for its scruff, sworn to by those allergic to allegiances.<br><br>*<br><br>A hotel can signal a getaway, a holiday, a spree, but it is also a vault of secrets, a haven, a port in a storm, a home away from home. People come and go from hotels all day every day for weeks, months, years. But a great hotel gives the impression of always being there, of having always been there, of being there forevermore.

Not in our school system, not in our synagogues, and not in our media. Nor do we have easy access to the New Testament. Jesus has been studiously avoided, and hidden from our people. Today in Israel, 99.7% of the Jewish population, reject Jesus as the Messiah. How did our country, where the gospel first took place, come to be so adamantly against it?Within Judaism over the last two millennia, any kind of spiritual message had to go through the &#x201c;gate keepers&#x201d;, the Orthodox Jewish Rabbis. The Rabbinic Judaism of the Orthodox comes directly from the sect of the &#x201c;Pharisees&#x201d;, whom Jesus rebuked:&#x201c;Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you shut off the kingdom of heaven from people; for you do not enter in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in.&#x201d; (Matthew 23:13)Ever since the days of Messiah, the Rabbis have set themselves in opposition to the gospel, blocking the message of Jesus from Israel. They deliberately prevent Jewish people from hearing about the free salvation offered to them in the death and resurrection of their own Jewish Messiah. They have gone to great lengths to conceal Jesus, and keep him the best kept secret in Judaism., keeping our people in spiritual darkness.But now the secret is out!After almost 2000 years, Jesus, or as we call him in Hebrew, Yeshua, can no longer be hidden from the people! Today, our ministry, ONE FOR ISRAEL, reaches Jewish and Arab Israelis exactly where they are &#x2013; online. We no longer need the rabbis&#x2019; permission for anything. We can go straight into the smartphones, tablets, and computers of every Israeli, sharing the saving good news of Yeshua the Messiah!In the past, the message of the gospel came to Israel from outside our borders, delivered by people who didn&#x2019;t understand our language, our culture, our heritage or our way of thinking. Today the messengers look very different. Now it is Jewish and Arab Israelis who are bringing the gospel back to where it started &#x2013; back to our own people Israel. We can explain the gospel to our people in a way that makes sense to them, in our own native tongues of Hebrew and Arabic as only Israelis can, and help our people understand who Yeshua really is.The Orthodox rabbis in Israel operate an &#x201c;anti missionary&#x201d; organization called Yad L'Achim, specifically to fight against the spread of the gospel among the Jewish people. This very well-funded organization, works very closely with the Minister of Interior in the Israeli government. They seek to prevent Jewish people from leaving the confines of Rabbinic Judaism by any means necessary (not always legally), and relentlessly persecute us, the Jewish believers in Jesus in Israel. With over 90% of the names, photos and addresses of all the Messianic Jews in Israel on file, Yad L&#x2019;Achim began sending a magazine called &#x201c;Searching&#x201d; to the homes of believers in Israel back in 2014. The magazine contains objections and refutations from Orthodox rabbis about the messiahship of Jesus, the credibility of the New Testament, and trying to ridicule and destroy the belief in Jesus. This caused several Jewish believers, even including some who had been missionaries, to deny their faith in Jesus and revert to rabbinic Judaism. Over the past five years, I decided to go over all of their magazines, books and videos, in order to answer their arguments and prove their objections false.

Grant?</h2><p>Ulysses S. Grant certainly does not have the typical war hero &#x201c;back story.&#x201d; Although a graduate of West Point, he never wanted to be a soldier and was terrified when he first saw battle. However, during the Civil War, after many Northern generals failed to deliver decisive victories, U.S. Grant rose to what the times required. He took command of Union forces, helped bring the war to an end in 1865, and went on to serve two terms as president.</p><p>Megan Stine has written several biographies for young readers, including&nbsp;<i>Who Is Michelle Obama?</i> and <i>Who Was Sally Ride? </i>She lives in Clinton, Connecticut.<b>Who Was Ulysses S. Grant?</b><p>It was a summer day in 1861. The Civil War&#x2014;the clash between Northern and Southern states&#x2014;was just beginning. A Northern officer, Colonel Ulysses S. Grant, was getting ready to lead about a thousand men into battle. That&#x2019;s what he&#x2019;d been trained to do. He had been an army officer for many years. He had fought in a war before.</p><p>But this was different. This was the first time Ulysses was in charge. It was the first time he was leading a huge group of men to fight&#x2014;and possibly die.</p><p>As Ulysses marched along, he began to get nervous. He later wrote that his heart pounded so hard, he could feel it in his throat.</p><p>The closer he got to the Southern troops, the more frightened Ulysses became. Secretly, he wished he could stop marching. But he couldn&#x2019;t do that. It was his job to keep going, no matter what happened next.</p><p>And guess what happened next: Ulysses found the enemy soldiers&#x2019; campsite. But the soldiers were gone! They had run away!</p><p>All at once, Ulysses realized something. The enemy soldiers had been just as afraid of him as he was of them.</p><p>From that day on, Ulysses S. Grant never let fear stand in his way.</p><p></p></p><h2>Adult Piano Adventures All-in-One Lesson Book 1</h2><p>(Faber Piano Adventures ). For adult beginners, use Adult Piano Adventures.

But she wasn&#x2019;t born fierce. Though she may have always known how to stand tall on the balance beam, Gabby had to learn how best to stand up for herself when those around her tried to knock her down<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The road to Olympic victory is full of obstacles. To become the first African American gymnast to win an individual all-around gold medal in the international competition, Gabby Douglas had to overcome many challenges&#x2014;including bullying by some of her own<br> teammates and teachers.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For Gabby (called &#x201c;Brie&#x201d; by her family), gymnastics was always easy. Even as a baby, she was already squeezing her tiny hands around the bars of her crib, just as she would one day do with the uneven bars.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At an age when most kids were learning to walk, Gabby was climbing and jumping around. As a toddler, she liked to clamber onto the top of a closet door and then leap off like Supergirl. Couches and chairs were springboards for her airborne adventures.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes Gabby&#x2019;s daredevil antics attracted unwanted attention. One day, as she was careening through the playground in a toy car, a bully approached and pushed her out of the driver&#x2019;s seat. Luckily for Gabby, her older brother Johnathan was there to help.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It would not be the last time Gabby would have to deal with bullies.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gabby&#x2019;s childhood became consumed with rolling and tumbling. When she was three, her older sister Arielle taught her how to do a cartwheel. By the very next day, Gabby had moved on to handstands, flips, and other tricky maneuvers. Within a week, she was doing one-handed cartwheels.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Amazed by her sister&#x2019;s progress, Arielle told their mom, Natalie Hawkins, that Gabby should start gymnastics lessons. But Natalie worried that her daughter would hurt herself, and she refused.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Over the next few years, the girls worked hard to wear down their mother&#x2019;s resistance. And although Natalie remained afraid that Gabby might injure herself doing gymnastics, she knew that lessons would help her daughter learn to do the movements properly. Without<br> the supervision of a trained adult, who knew what she would jump off next?<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So when Gabby was six, Natalie signed her up at a local gym that offered weekend gymnastics classes. Soon Gabby was receiving formal instruction for about six hours a week.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After two years, Gabby was ready to move on to the next level of training. Her mother found another gym that provided more rigorous instruction. The goal there was to train young gymnasts to compete and win tournaments at the highest level, including the Olympics.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At first, Gabby thrived at her new gym. She made friends and learned techniques and strategies from her coaches. But as she improved at gymnastics, Gabby noticed that some of the students began treating her differently. Sometimes she&#x2019;d see the girls whispering to one another when she entered the locker room. As soon as they saw Gabby, they&#x2019;d stop talking.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then, one day, when it was time to clean the chalk off the uneven bars after class, one of Gabby&#x2019;s teammates greeted her with a cruel taunt. &#x201c;Why doesn&#x2019;t Gabby do it?&#x201d; the girl asked. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s our slave.&#x201d; Gabby was terribly hurt by the remark, but she didn&#x2019;t confront the girl or say anything to her instructors. It wasn&#x2019;t until years later that she found the courage to talk<br> about the incident, though she never forgot about it during that time.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another time, one of Gabby&#x2019;s coaches made fun of her appearance. &#x201c;She needs a nose job,&#x201d; he joked in front of the other girls. Once again, Gabby gritted her teeth and continued with practice. But when she got home that night&#x2014;and on many other nights&#x2014;she cried alone<br> in her room.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gabby knew she&#x2019;d been bullied, and she suspected it was because she was the only African American girl in the class. But she was afraid that if she spoke up, she&#x2019;d be isolated even more&#x2014;maybe even thrown out of the gymnastics program altogether. So she held her tongue<br> and kept the hurtful comments to herself. She didn&#x2019;t even tell her mother.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Over time, the bullying took a toll on Gabby&#x2019;s performance. She finished in tenth place at her first junior gymnastics competition. At another event, she placed sixteenth and failed to qualify for the U.S. national team. In practices, she butted heads with her coaches. Convinced that she needed to test herself, she begged them to let her try out increasingly difficult routines. But where Gabby sought excellence, her coaches seemed satisfied with mediocrity. One time, after Gabby finished in fourth place at a tournament, her coach was amazed.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I thought you might be ninth or tenth,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but never fourth!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gabby had finally reached her breaking point. How could she have faith in her abilities if her own coach thought so little of her? She knew that it was time to stand up for herself, put an end to the bullying, and find a coach who believed in her.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Luckily for Gabby, she found just such a mentor. Liang Chow had coached U.S. gymnast Shawn Johnson to a gold medal at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China. He ran his own gymnastics academy in West Des Moines, Iowa.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the summer of 2010, Coach Chow traveled to Gabby&#x2019;s hometown of Virginia Beach to teach a clinic and look for new talent. On his first day in town, Gabby worked up the nerve to introduce herself and show off some of her skills.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Coach Chow was impressed. He was also friendly and patient, taking the time to show Gabby new moves and expressing confidence in her abilities.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gabby left the clinic determined to break from her current gym. Now all she had to do was convince her mother to let her go.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;If I&#x2019;m going to make it to the Olympics, I need better coaching,&#x201d; Gabby told her mom. Natalie Hawkins understood&#x2014;especially after Gabby revealed details about the bullying she had endured. But the next thing Gabby said threw her for a loop: &#x201c;I want to train with Liang Chow in Iowa...&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Absolutely not, Gabby&#x2019;s mom replied. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no way I&#x2019;m sending my baby across the country.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But Gabby knew she had to take a stand for what she believed in&#x2014;she had only two short years before the next Olympic Games! Faced with her mother&#x2019;s refusal, all she could feel was frustration and anger. &#x201c;If I don&#x2019;t change coaches, I&#x2019;m quitting gymnastics!&#x201d; she declared,<br> and then she stormed out of the room.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When her anger cooled, Gabby realized that threatening to quit unless she got her way was not a smart idea. Teamwork was the way to go. Once again, she enlisted her sisters Arielle and Joyelle to help convince their mother to change her mind. Finally, after much begging and pleading, they wore her down. Natalie realized that when her youngest daughter set her heart on something, she wouldn&#x2019;t let go. She agreed to let Gabby leave home to pursue her Olympic dream.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In October of 2010, Gabby packed her bags and made the thousand-mile trip from Virginia Beach to West Des Moines. She moved in with a host family and began training with Coach Chow six hours a day, six days a week. Gabby missed her family. There were days during the long, frigid winter when she thought about giving up and returning home to sunny Virginia Beach.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But with the help of her new coach, Gabby consistently improved on each apparatus. She led the U.S. team to a gold medal at the 2011 World Championships in Tokyo and then collected gold, silver, and bronze medals at the U.S. National Championships in 2012.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Later that year, the sixteen-year-old phenomenon&#x2014;now known affectionately as the &#x201c;Flying Squirrel&#x201d;&#x2014;led the American gymnasts to victory in the team competition at the Olympics. After all the bullying she&#x2019;d experienced, and all the hard work she&#x2019;d put in practicing,&nbsp;Gabby had finally found a team with whom she could shine. She was now one of the fabulous &#x201c;Fierce Five.&#x201d;</p><h2>How to Draw Animals in Simple Steps</h2><p>Learn how to draw cute household pets, impressive wild animals and amazing birds using this fun and easy step-by-step method. Starting with simple shapes, four popular artists show how easy it is to develop circles, rectangles, squares and ovals into an exciting selection of creatures including cats, dogs, horses, lions, elephants, monkeys, penguins and eagles. If you have never drawn before this is definitely the book for you, and there is a lot here to inspire more experienced artists too.<br> Uses material from the How to Draw series.</p><p>Eva Dutton is a professional artist and qualified riding instructor (BHSAI) and stable manager (BHS). She studied fine art at Norwich School of Art and has spent many years combining her love of painting with her professional equestrian work. She currently works to commission and exhibits widely. As well as her love for horses, she has a passion for wildlife and the landscape. She is now painting wolves and other creatures as well as farm and domestic animals. Eva is a member of the Society of Equestrian Artists and she is currently working full time as a professional artist and illustrator. She lives in Shropshire.This is a compilation of five previous books on drawing cats, dogs, wild animals, birds and horses, not a brand new book. If you don&#39;t have these previous titles you can now obtain them in one handy volume with nothing omitted. Each page (larger than UK size A4) shows you how to draw an animal or bird, starting with a rough outline and adding more in subsequent diagrams (usually six). The last two show the drawing shaded in pencil and finally with paint added for a colored study. One helpful aspect of this is that each additional drawing shows what has been added to it in a different colored pencil, although in some cases more stages would have made the book even more user-friendly. For a beginner it is not always obvious how to get from a simple line drawing to the fully shaded study next in line, but working it all out is perhaps part of the fun. Certainly this is a beautifully simple approach to drawing, where there are no captions - they frankly just aren&#39;t necessary - just steps to work through. I enjoyed using it, and anybody who wants to learn how to draw a range of different creatures will too.-Myshelf.com Another one from the popular How to Draw range, this time a compilation of individual books brought together to cover cats, dogs, birds, wild animals and my favourite section - horses. The artists show us in a series of simple steps how to create a selection of different animals in a variety of characteristic poses. They use a simple method of shapes, mainly circles and ovals joined together by lines to show us how easy it is to draw these, in a step by step format from the initial step to the finished portrait. The beauty of this book is that like all the How to Draw series it&#39;s so simple to follow each step. The first step is drawn in one pencil colour and subsequent steps in a different one, with the last step changing back to original colour. Its incredibly easy for even a very beginner to create great drawings following these simple instructions. Although all the poses are very typical of the individual animal( and birds!) my favourite are the horse ones. Having tried so many times to photograph my own horse moving and failed - I really only get a good picture when she&#39;s grazing - using this book I&#39;ll hopefully be able to tailor the poses into some lovely paintings of her. And of course use the individual portraits to bring some life into other paintings. If you&#39;d love to draw but think you can&#39;t this book is the one you want, it demystifies all those problems and shows you just how simple drawing is by following a few key instructions.-JeannieZelos.com The ability to draw has many uses, including creating patterns for machine knitting. Learn how to draw cute household pets, wild animals and amazing birds using this fun and easy step-by-step method. If you&#39;ve never drawn before this is definitely the book for you and there&#39;s a lot here to inspire more experienced artists too.-Machine Knitting Monthly</p><h2>My First Christmas</h2><p>In&nbsp;<i>My First Christmas</i>, warm illustrations and easy-to-follow text celebrate the joys and traditions of this special holiday.

Although I knew from the age of ten that I wanted to be an artist, it took a long time to discover just what kind of an artist I would be.</p><p>"When I was in art school, first at Pratt Institute and then at Portland School of Art, I was a painting major. To be honest, though, I was classified as a painting major because no one could figure out where else to put me. At that time I was making Joseph Cornell-like box constructions, with collage, found objects, and drawings. Graduation from art school left me unable to afford a large enough living space to store all the wonderful junk necessary for my constructions, so I devoted myself almost completely to my drawing.</p><p>"After exhibiting my work several times during the next few years, I was encouraged by a friend familiar with publishing to try my hand at illustration.

The garden creatures appearing on every page and grandpa, whom we catch sight of now and then, are a delightful supporting cast. Nonreaders can easily follow the story in pictures alone. Very large, clear print on facing pages makes the simple narrative inviting for beginning readers, too. Libraries serving young children shouldn't miss this satisfying book in the tradition of Ruth Krauss and Crockett Johnson's The Carrot Seed (Harper, 1945) and Bijou Le Tord's Rabbit Seeds (Four Winds, 1984). The strong sense of the cycles of nature and a youngster's accomplishment make for a winning combination.

But the night before the big day, she begins to have second thoughts. &#x2018;I don't feel well,&#x2019; she says the next morning. &#x2018;You just have butterflies in your belly,&#x2019; her mother replies with a hug. And sure enough, when a girl on the school bus asks her name, a butterfly escapes from Rosie's mouth along with the answer. Rosie's trepidation about new experiences tugs on readers' hearts, but as the butterflies that only she can see are released every time she participates in class, her expressions grow more confident and joyful. Finally, Rosie uses her new confidence to help another classmate who looks like she has a belly full of butterflies as well. Colorful illustrations depict children of varying skin tones with surprisingly expressive round black eyes; Rosie and her family present subtly Asian. Young readers who are worried about school will find a reassuring way to put their feelings into words, and the warm ending gives a wink to caregivers who may also find themselves feeling nervous about the first day of school.

She&#x2019;s puzzled when her mother tells her she has butterflies in her stomach, but while chatting to a friendly girl on the school bus, Rosie finally understands when butterflies (seemingly visible only to her) flutter from her mouth. Throughout the morning, &#x2018;butterflies rumbled in Rosie&#x2019;s belly&#x2019; and occasionally slip out, but by recess she feels fine and reaches out to a forlorn classmate standing alone&#x2014;whose own butterflies escape.

The next morning her belly hurts and she cannot even eat her breakfast. Her mother reassures her, &#x2018;You just have butterflies in your belly&#x2019; and hugs her tight. Once on the bus, she quickly makes a new friend, and a butterfly flies out while she&#x2019;s talking. Her new friend doesn&#x2019;t seem to notice, and as they continue to talk, more butterflies flutter out. Throughout the day, the butterflies, unnoticed by everyone else, fly out of her mouth. Rosie&#x2019;s belly begins to feel much better. At recess, she even helps a fellow student get a butterfly out of her belly by saying hello. Rosie&#x2019;s mom has a butterfly of her own fly out once she realizes that Rosie had a great first day. <b>The mixed-media illustrations match the text well, and the bright colors fit the story&#x2019;s theme well.

Parks, the first African American to work at Life magazine and the first to write, direct, and score a Hollywood film, told an interviewer in 1999, "I saw that the camera could be a weapon against poverty, against racism, against all sorts of social wrongs.

Just about the juiciest tidbit I've ever seen. Nice and chubby with spiky legs and wiggly antennae. A real dream of a cricket.</i><br> <i>Now all I have to do is grab it with my great, long tongue</i><br> <i>and flick it back into my mouth and YUM! The time is right&#x2014;</i><br> "SQUEAK-SQUEAK-SQUEAK!"<br> BOING! There's no cricket in sight. Not even any tall grass. I guess it was just a daydream.<br> Instead of the swamp, I'm in my tank in Room 26 of Longfellow School, and that furry guy in the cage next door is at it again.<br> "SQUEAK-SQUEAK-SQUEAK!" I haven't been here long, but so far, that's all he says in his high-pitched little squeal.<br> I've never seen anyone in the swamp like him.<br> He's hairy with beady little eyes and big whiskers. Kind of like a mouse with a short tail, but chubbier. His fur is an odd shade of yellowish brown&#x2014;is that natural? And then there&#x2019;s the constant, high-pitched squeaking. (I think he&#x2019;s a little bit wacky.)<br> My skin feels dry, so I plop myself into the large bowl of water in my tank.<br> SPLASH!<br> The water here is a lot cleaner than it was back in the swamp where I used to live. The teacher puts in fresh water every day. It&#x2019;s nice, although a little bit of muck never hurt anybody.<br> &#x201c;A little less splashing over there,&#x201d; the teacher says. I pop my head up above the water and see that she&#x2019;s smiling at me.<br> &#x201c;Who . . . me?&#x201d; I ask.<br> Some of the students giggle. They <i>like</i> to giggle.<br> I haven&#x2019;t been in school for long, but I have figured out that the big human is the teacher and the smaller humans are her students. It&#x2019;s just like Granny Greenleaf teaching the little tadpoles back in the swamp, but these tads are much bigger.<br> I have no idea why the furry guy and I are here. We don&#x2019;t have a single thing in common with the humans or each other.<br> Don&#x2019;t get me wrong. While the squeaking sometimes gets under my bright green skin (with snazzy black polka dots), I&#x2019;m glad to be living in Room 26 and out of Room 27.<br> I&#x2019;d rather be back in the swamp, but I was hoppy to go anywhere to get away from George.<br> In fact, for a while all I could think about was getting away from George.<br> George is the <i>other</i> frog back in Miss Loomis&#x2019;s class, where I started out at Longfellow School. He was <i>not</i> a nice frog. To be fair, until I came along, he was the only frog in Room 27. I guess he liked it that way.<br> But it wasn&#x2019;t my idea to move to a classroom. I was content to live in the swamp. It was a paradise for frogs, offering every kind of yummy insect you can imagine!<br> I ate crickets for breakfast, dragonflies for lunch, beetles and grasshoppers for dinner and mosquitoes as a bedtime snack. There were also lovely snails and other small crunchy creatures. Yum! There was plenty of water to keep my skin wet, and there were damp, grassy places where I could hide.<br> I had to do that often, because there was danger, too. Beaky birds and slithery snakes. Lurking lizards and some furry foes as well.<br> But I can swim, and I can leap, and it was always just a hop, skip and a jump to safety! Once I reached a soggy and sticky hideaway, I could daydream to my heart&#x2019;s content. And I do like to daydream!<br> Every morning, I looked up at the sky and sang a joyful song.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Let us sing to life in the swamp, </i><br> <i>Where we hop and leap and romp.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>What&#x2019;s that I see over there in the thicket?</i><br> <i>Joy, oh joy, it&#x2019;s a lovely cricket!</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>As I sit in the morning dew, </i><br> <i>Swamp, oh swamp, I sing to you!</i><br> &nbsp;<br> I thought that George might like my song, but no, he most definitely did not. There was nothing he liked about me.<br> You see, George is a bullfrog, and it&#x2019;s well known that bullfrogs are the bullies of the swamp.<br> For one thing, they are BIG. They are also loud and bossy. You get a group of bullfrogs together at night, and you won&#x2019;t believe the racket! They call it singing. I call it an uproar.<br> The worst was a critter named Louie the Loudmouth. Louie was all mouth and no brain. I think he was related to George.<br> Louie mouthed off nonstop, until one day when a long- legged crane silenced him forever. There was peace in the swamp at last.<br> But there was no peace with George in Room 27.<br> He was a bully who took an instant dislike to me and let me know it.<br> George said <i>terrible</i> things to me, day in and day out. I won&#x2019;t repeat any of it, because he said insults that tadpoles&#x2014; big or small&#x2014;should never have to hear!<br> It was awful, but thankfully I learned to block it out, so<br> I heard what the humans heard:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;RUM-RUM. RUM-RUM. RUM-RUM. RUM-RUM!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Sometimes I&#x2019;d politely answer with the clear, strong call of a green frog.<br> &#x201c;BOING!&#x201d; I&#x2019;d say. &#x201c;Oh, really? You think so?&#x201d;<br> Ordinary frogs may croak, but green frogs like me have a special twanging sound.<br> &#x201c;Who says?&#x201d; I&#x2019;d repeat with a boing.<br> Green frogs are proud of our twangs. When we go boing, every critter in the swamp knows exactly who we are.<br> But George wasn&#x2019;t impressed. He got even louder.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;RUM-RUM. RUM-RUM!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> And so it went, all day long. All that noise made Miss Loomis as jumpy as a jackrabbit. She could hardly teach because George was so loud.<br> The problem didn&#x2019;t stop at night, either. I&#x2019;m not sure George ever slept, because he kept up a steady stream of RUM-RUMs all night long.<br> There was never time to do what I like best: Float. Doze. Be. That&#x2019;s when I just let my mind drift like a cloud. I always get my best ideas this way.<br> So when Miss Loomis explained to the class that I&#x2019;d be leaving Room 27 and moving to Room 26, my heart started beating like a hummingbird&#x2019;s wings.<br> I didn&#x2019;t know anything about Room 26, but it had to be better than living next door to George. Anyplace would be better without George.<br> The teacher in Room 26 is called Mrs. Brisbane, and she seems nice. She&#x2019;s not a bit jumpy, like Miss Loomis was. She&#x2019;s as steady as a salamander.<br> She speaks in a voice that&#x2019;s soft but not too soft. She has a nice smile and sharp eyes like an eagle that could quiet even George down with a single glance. (Well, maybe.)<br> In my short stay in Room 27, I learned to piece together some of the sounds humans in the classroom make. But it wasn&#x2019;t easy with George going RUM-RUM all the time.<br> A lesson in Room 27 sounded like this: &#x201c;Class, take out your books and turn to page RUM-RUM!&#x201d;<br> Or, &#x201c;The capital of Spain is RUM-RUM, RUM-RUM!&#x201d;<br> It&#x2019;s a wonder the students learned anything.<br> I found out more about human speech over the holidays, when Miss Loomis took George and me home for the break. Of course, she couldn&#x2019;t leave us near each other without George rattling off a thunderstorm of RUMs. So she put him in a room at one end of her house and put my tank in a room at the other end.<br> I was in the room with the picture box&#x2014;which I later learned is called a television.<br> Sometimes Miss Loomis would fall asleep while watching, and the television would be on all night. That&#x2019;s when I really learned to understand human talk. Words like <i>news</i> and <i>pain relief</i>. And the quiz shows were very educational.<br> For instance, did you know that there are places called deserts that get less than ten inches of rainfall a year? I don&#x2019;t think my frog friends and I will be moving to a desert any- time soon!<br> And the capital of Spain is actually Madrid.<br> The most fascinating fact I learned from a game show is that the longest frog leap that has been recorded is&#x2014;are you ready?&#x2014;33 feet, 5.5 inches! I&#x2019;m going to need a lot of practice to beat that record!<br> Of course, I don&#x2019;t have that much room to leap in my tank.<br> &nbsp;<br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> When I first came to Room 26&#x2014;with Mrs. Brisbane&#x2019;s nice voice and no George to interrupt&#x2014;I was able to hear what was going on for a change.<br> Miss Loomis carried my tank into the classroom, and the students were as excited to see me as I am when I zero in on a cricket.<br> All eyes were on me as she explained about George not getting along with me. Including a pair of beady little eyes<br> that belonged to the scrawny little fluff ball in the cage next to me.<br> Someone made a strange noise&#x2014;&#x201c;Ribbit.&#x201d; It didn&#x2019;t sound like anything I&#x2019;d heard back in the swamp, but everyone laughed again.<br> When Mrs. Brisbane said that I&#x2019;d make a nice friend for Humphrey, I heard a little squeak from the furry guy next door. He must be called Humphrey!<br> After Miss Loomis left, the students gathered around my tank for a closer look. All except one, a red-haired girl who looked as miserable as a toothless swamp beaver.<br> The students had a lot of questions, and Mrs. Brisbane had the answers. She explained that I am an amphibian, so I am cold-blooded.<br> She said that hamsters like Humphrey are warm- blooded. So Humphrey must be a hamster!<br> I heard some tiny squeaks coming from next door . . . and then I let out a great, big &#x201c;BOING!&#x201d;<br> The students burst into laughter. They all laughed every time I said, &#x201c;BOING!&#x201d;<br> It was like a game. I&#x2019;d say, &#x201c;BOING,&#x201d; and everybody would laugh.<br> A boing may mean I&#x2019;m happy or sad or may be an answer to a question, but unfortunately, humans can&#x2019;t understand me.<br> When the big tads wanted to know what I eat, Mrs. Brisbane told them, &#x201c;Miss Loomis said he likes insects,&#x201d; which is true. Just thinking about a nice, juicy cricket makes my tongue tingle.<br> But the students all said, &#x201c;Ewwww!&#x201d; and made faces. Except for Humphrey, who let out a series of three high- pitched squeaks.<br> &#x201c;SQUEAK-SQUEAK-SQUEAK!&#x201d;<br> I&#x2019;m not sure you&#x2019;d even hear him in the swamp, with all the loud animals there, especially the bullfrogs. Still, his squeaks don&#x2019;t sound mean like George&#x2019;s rumblings. He seems harmless but slightly irritating, like a furry fly. And he&#x2019;s such a fuzzy little thing, he&#x2019;s no threat to me. He couldn&#x2019;t even scare a slug.<br> Mrs. Brisbane assured them that eating crickets is nor- mal for frogs&#x2014;yes, ma&#x2019;am! Luckily, Miss Loomis had sent a jar of crickets along with me. Life is better with a jar full of crickets&#x2014;and no George.<br> From when I first got here this morning, I thought Room<br> 26 would be an improvement over Room 27. But as Granny<br> Greenleaf always said, &#x201c;Only time will tell.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> Just like in Miss Loomis&#x2019;s room, when a bell rings in Room<br> 26, the big tads all leave the classroom, but the furry fellow and I stay.<br> BING-BANG-BOING! Without George, the quiet is a relief.<br> I am just about to doze off when I hear that sound again.<br> It&#x2019;s something squeaky, but this time it doesn&#x2019;t sound like the furry guy.<br> <i>Screech-screech-screech!</i><br> I glance over at his cage, and what do you know? My tiny neighbor is running inside a great big wheel.<br> <i>Screech-screech-screech!</i><br> Snakes alive! Who spins in a wheel? Nobody in the swamp does that.<br> Then he starts squeaking. <br> &#x201c;Squeak-squeak-squeak!&#x201d; <br> <i>Screech-screech-screech!</i><br> It isn&#x2019;t nearly as bad as being around George, but sud- denly, I am a little homesick for the buzzing, humming, rus- tling, rattling, croaking, chirping and swishing sounds of the swamp.<br> I climb into my water bowl to reflect on my day. It&#x2019;s eas- ier to think when I&#x2019;m damp.<br> The screeching and squeaking sounds are a lot softer underwater. But then the bell rings, which even underwater, I can hear.<br> The students come back, and soon Mrs. Brisbane is talk- ing about my old home. Wow! I never knew how old the trees around the swamp might be! Even older than old Granny Greenleaf!<br> It&#x2019;s odd to spend all afternoon indoors. Back in the swamp, I spent my afternoons looking for food. (Sometimes I came up short.) Of course, I don&#x2019;t have to do that now.<br> I don&#x2019;t have anything to do here. It&#x2019;s an easy life (but maybe a little dull).<br> After a while, the bell rings one more time.<br> I pop my head up and watch as the students leave again: the boy with glasses who&#x2019;s always the first out the door, the loud boy, the shy girl, the giggling one.<br> Before long, the furry guy and I are all alone in Room 26. I snooze on my rock for a while, but it&#x2019;s not easy to sleep<br> with that round thing on the wall ticking so loudly.<br> The humans look at it to know what time it is. I guess they never thought of just looking up at the sky: the sun, the moon and the stars. You can tell what time it is in the swamp without ticking noises or loud bells.<br> The room slowly turns dark, and I am hoppy that the furry guy is quiet. Maybe he&#x2019;s dozing, too.<br> And then, all at once, my neighbor flings open the door of his cage and scurries over to my tank. Wouldn&#x2019;t you think somebody would put a lock on that door?<br> &#x201c;SQUEAK-SQUEAK-SQUEAK! SQUEAK-SQUEAK- SQUEAK-SQUEAK!&#x201d; he says in a very excited voice.<br> I think he&#x2019;s trying to tell me something. Does he think I understand?<br> Frogs and furry creatures are <i>never</i> friends in the swamp. Still . . . he&#x2019;s a lot friendlier than George ever was.<br> I decide to give him a glorious green frog greeting.<br> I leap toward my neighbor and say, &#x201c;Hoppy to meet you! BOING-BOING!&#x201d; in my fabulous froggy way.<br> And would you believe it? The furry guy looks shocked. He leaps backward, races to his cage and slams the door<br> behind him.<br> After a while, there is only the ticking noise and the gentle song of crickets in the room.<br> So much for friendship!</p><h2>Richard Scarry&#39;s The Night Before the Night Before Christmas!</h2><p><b>Richard Scarry and Christmas combine to create this adventurous holiday picture book inspired by the classic poem, "The Night Before Christmas."</b><br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s Christmas, and Richard Scarry&#x2019;s beloved cast of Busytown characters are gearing up for the holiday!

If they are awakened, if the gauze wrapping their bodies is disturbed or violated, the women become feral and spectacularly violent. And while they sleep they go to another place, a better place, where harmony prevails and conflict is rare. One woman, the mysterious &#x201c;Eve Black,&#x201d; is immune to the blessing or curse of the sleeping disease. Is Eve a medical anomaly to be studied? Or is she a demon who must be slain?<br> <br>Abandoned, left to their increasingly primal urges, the men divide into warring factions, some wanted to kill Eve, some to save her. Others exploit the chaos to wreak their own vengeance on new enemies. All turn to violence in a suddenly all-male world. Set in a small Appalachian town whose primary employer is a woman&#x2019;s prison, <i>Sleeping Beauties </i>is a wildly provocative, gloriously dramatic father-son collaboration that feels particularly urgent and relevant today.</p><p>Stephen King is the author of more than sixty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.&nbsp;His recent work includes&nbsp;<i>The Institute</i>, <i>Elevation</i>, <i>The Outsider</i>,&nbsp;<i>Sleeping Beauties</i>&nbsp;(cowritten with his son Owen King), and the Bill Hodges trilogy:&nbsp;<i>End of Watch</i>,&nbsp;<i>Finders&nbsp;Keepers</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Mr. Mercedes</i>&nbsp;(an Edgar Award winner&nbsp;for Best Novel and an AT&amp;T Audience Network original television series).

Follow him on Twitter @RickYancey.1<br> This is my body. <br> In the cave&#x2019;s lowermost chamber, the priest raises the last wa�fer&#x2014;his supply has been exhausted&#x2014;toward the formations that remind him of a dragon&#x2019;s mouth frozen in mid-roar, the growths like teeth glistening red and yellow in the lamplight. <br> The catastrophe of the divine sacrifice by his hands. <br> <i> Take this, all of you, and eat of it . . . </i><br> Then the chalice containing the final drops of wine. <br> <i> Take this, all of you, and drink from it . . . </i><br> Midnight in late November. In the caves below, the small band of survivors will remain warm and hidden with enough supplies to last until spring. No one has died of the plague in months. The worst appears to be over. They are safe here, perfectly safe. <br> <i> With faith in your love and mercy, I eat your body and drink your blood . . . </i><br> His whispers echo in the deep. They clamber up the slick walls, skitter along the narrow passage toward the upper chambers, where his fellow refugees have fallen into a restless sleep. <br> <i> Let it not bring me condemnation, but health in mind and body. </i><br> There is no more bread, no more wine. This is his final communion. <br> <i> May the body of Christ bring me to everlasting life.</i><br> The stale fragment of bread that softens on his tongue. <br> <i> May the blood of Christ bring me to everlasting life. </i><br> The drops of soured wine that burn his throat. <br> God in his mouth. God in his empty stomach. <br> The priest weeps. <br> He pours a few drops of water into the chalice. His hand shakes. He drinks the precious blood commingled with water, then wipes clean the chalice with the purificator. <br> It is finished. The everlasting sacrifice is over. He dabs his cheeks on the same cloth he used to clean the chalice. The tears of man and the blood of God inseparable. Nothing new in that. <br> He wipes clean the paten with the cloth, then stuffs the purifi�cator into the chalice and sets it aside. He pulls the green stole from his neck, folds it carefully, kisses it. He loved everything about being a priest. Loved the Mass most of all. <br> His collar is damp with sweat and tears and loose about his neck: He&#x2019;s lost fifteen pounds since the plague struck and aban�doned his parish to make the hundred-mile journey to the caverns north of Urbana. Along the way he gained many followers&#x2014;over fifty in all, though thirty-two died from the infection before reach�ing safety. As their deaths approached, he spoke the rite, Catholic, Protestant, or Jew, it didn&#x2019;t matter: <i>May the Lord in his love and mercy help you . . . </i>Tracing a cross on their hot foreheads with his thumb. <i>May the Lord who frees you from sin save you . . . </i><br> The blood that seeped from their eyes mixed with the oil he rubbed on their lids. And smoke rolled across open fields and hunkered in woods and capped over roads like ice over languid rivers in deep winter. Fires in Columbus. Fires in Springfield and Dayton. In Huber Heights and London and Fairborn. In Frank�lin and Middletown and Xenia. In the evenings the light from a thousand fires turned the smoke a dusky orange, and the sky sank to an inch above their heads. The priest shuffled through the smoldering landscape with one hand outstretched, pressing a rag over his nose and mouth with the other while tears of protest streamed down his face. Blood crusted beneath his broken nails, blood caked in the lines of his hands and in the soles of his shoes. <i>Not much farther, </i>he encouraged his companions. <i>Keep moving. </i>Along the way, someone nicknamed him Father Moses, for he was leading his people out of the obscurity of smoke and fire to the Promised Land of &#x201c;Ohio&#x2019;s Most Colorful Caverns!&#x201d; <br> People were there, of course, to greet them when they arrived. The priest expected it. A cave does not burn. It is impervious to weather. Best of all, it&#x2019;s easy to defend. After military bases and government buildings, caves were the most popular destinations in the aftermath of the Arrival. <br> Supplies had been gathered, water and nonperishables, blan�kets and bandages and medicines. And weapons, naturally, rifles and pistols and shotguns and many knives. The sick were quaran�tined in the welcome center aboveground, lying in cots arranged between the display shelves of the gift shop, and every day the priest visited them, spoke with them, prayed with them, heard their confessions, delivered communion, whispered the things they wanted to hear: <i>Per sacrosancta humanae reparationis mys�teria . . . By the sacred mysteries of man&#x2019;s redemption . . . </i><br> Hundreds would die before the dying was over. They dug a pit ten feet wide and thirty feet deep to the south of the welcome center to burn them. The fire smoldered day and night, and the smell of burning flesh had become so commonplace, they hardly noticed. <br> Now it&#x2019;s November, and in the lowermost chamber the priest rises. He is not tall; still, he must stoop to avoid smacking his head into the ceiling or against the stone teeth that bristle from the roof of the dragon&#x2019;s mouth. <br> <i> The Mass is ended, go in peace. </i><br> He leaves behind the chalice and the purificator, the paten and his stole. They are relics now, artifacts from an age receding into the past at the speed of light. <i>We began as cave dwellers, </i>the priest thinks as he makes his way toward the surface, <i>and to caves we have returned. </i><br> Even the longest journey is a circle, and history will always cycle back to the place where it began. From the missal: &#x201c;Remem�ber you are dust and unto dust you shall return.&#x201d; <br> And the priest rises like a diver kicking toward the dome of the sky sparkling above the water. <br> Along the narrow passageway that winds gently upward be�tween walls of weeping stone, the floor is as smooth as the lanes of a bowling alley. Only a few months before, schoolchildren on field trips marched in single file, trailing their fingers along the rock face, their eyes searching for monsters in the shadows that pooled in the crevices. They were still young enough to believe in monsters. <br> And the priest rising like a leviathan from the lightless deep. <br> The trail to the surface runs past the Caveman&#x2019;s Couch and the Crystal King, into the Big Room, the main living area for the refu�gees, and finally into the Palace of the Gods, his favorite part of the caverns, where crystalline formations shine like frozen shards of moonlight and the ceiling sensually undulates like waves roll�ing in to shore. Here, close to the surface, the air thins, becomes drier, tinged with the smoke of the fires that still feed upon the world they left behind. <br> <i> Lord, bless these ashes by which we show that we are dust. </i><br> Snatches of prayer run through his mind. Fragments of song. Litanies and blessings and the words of absolution, <i>May God give you pardon and peace, and I absolve you from your sins . . . </i>And from the Bible: &#x201c;I went down to the roots of the mountains; to the land whose bars closed behind me forever.&#x201d; <br> Incense burning in the censer. Soft spring sunlight shattered by stained glass. The creaking of the pews on Sunday like the hull of an ancient vessel far at sea. The stately measure of the seasons, the calendar that governed his life from the time he was an infant, Advent, Christmas, Lent, Easter. He knows he loved the wrong things, the rituals and traditions, the pomp and foppery for which outsiders faulted the Church. He adored the form, not the sub�stance; the bread, not the body. <br> It didn&#x2019;t make him a bad priest. He was quiet and humble and faithful to his calling. He enjoyed helping people. These weeks in the cave had been some of the most fulfilling of his life. Suffering brings God to his natural home, the manger of terror and confu�sion, pain and loss, where he was born. <i>Turn over the currency of suffering, </i>the priest thinks, <i>and you will see his face. </i><br> A watchman sits just inside the opening above the Palace of the Gods, his burly frame silhouetted against the spray of stars beyond him. The sky has been scrubbed clean by a stiff north wind auguring winter. The man wears a baseball cap pulled low over his forehead, and a worn leather jacket. He&#x2019;s holding a pair of binoculars. A rifle rests in his lap. <br> The man nods a hello to the priest. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s your coat, Father? It&#x2019;s a cold one tonight.&#x201d; <br> The priest smiles wanly. &#x201c;I lent it to Agatha, I&#x2019;m afraid.&#x201d; <br> The man grunts his understanding. Agatha is the complainer of the group. Always cold.&nbsp;Always hungry. Always <i>something. </i>He lifts the binoculars to his eyes and scans the sky. <br> &#x201c;Have you seen any more of them?&#x201d; the priest asks. They spotted the first grayish-silver, cigar-shaped object a week before, hanging motionlessly above the caverns for several minutes be�fore silently shooting straight up, dwindling to a pinprick scar in the vast blue. Another&#x2014;or the same one&#x2014;appeared two days later, gliding soundlessly over them until it dropped beneath the horizon. There was no question about the origin of these strange craft&#x2014;the cave dwellers knew they weren&#x2019;t terrestrial&#x2014;it was the mystery of their purpose that frightened them. <br> The man lowers the binoculars and rubs his eyes. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter, Father? Can&#x2019;t sleep?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Oh, I don&#x2019;t sleep much these days,&#x201d; the priest says. Then he adds, &#x201c;So much to do.&#x201d; He doesn&#x2019;t want the man to think he&#x2019;s complaining. <br> &#x201c;No atheists in foxholes.&#x201d; The clich� hangs in the air like a rancid smell. <br> &#x201c;Or in caves,&#x201d; the priest says. Since they met, he has strained to know this man better, but he is a closed room, the door se�curely dead-bolted by anger and grief and the hopeless dread of the doomed living on borrowed time. For months there&#x2019;s been no turning from it or hiding from it. For some, death is the midwife to faith. For others, it is faith&#x2019;s executioner. <br> The man pulls a pack of gum from his breast pocket, carefully unwraps a piece, and folds it into his mouth. He counts the re�maining sticks before slipping the pack back into his pocket. He does not offer any to the priest. <br> &#x201c;My last pack,&#x201d; the man says in explanation. He shifts his weight on the cold stone.<br> &#x201c;I understand,&#x201d; the priest says. <br> &#x201c;Do you?&#x201d; The man&#x2019;s jaw moves with a hypnotic rhythm as he chews. &#x201c;Do you really?&#x201d; <br> The dry bread, the soured wine: The taste lingers on his tongue. The bread could have been broken; the wine could have been di�vided. He did not have to celebrate the Mass alone. &#x201c;I believe that I do,&#x201d; the little priest answers. <br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; the man says slowly and deliberately. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe in a goddamned thing.&#x201d; <br> The priest blushes. His soft, embarrassed laughter is like the patter of children&#x2019;s feet up a long staircase. He touches his collar nervously. <br> &#x201c;When the power died, I believed it would come back on,&#x201d; the man with the rifle says. &#x201c;Everybody did. The power goes out&#x2014;the power comes back on. That&#x2019;s faith, right?&#x201d; He gnawed the gum, left side, right side, pushing the green knob back and forth with his tongue. &#x201c;Then the news trickles in from the coasts that there are no coasts anymore. Now Reno is prime oceanfront property. Big deal; so what? There&#x2019;ve been earthquakes before. There&#x2019;ve been tsunamis. Who needs New York? What&#x2019;s so special about Califor�nia? We&#x2019;ll bounce back. We always bounce back. I believed that.&#x201d; <br> The watchman is nodding, staring at the night sky, at the cold, blazing stars. Eyes high, voice low. &#x201c;Then people got sick. Anti�biotics. Quarantines. Disinfectants. We put on masks and washed our hands until our skin peeled off. Most of us died anyway.&#x201d; <br> And the man with the rifle watches the stars as if waiting for them to shake loose from the black and tumble to the Earth. Why shouldn&#x2019;t they? <br> &#x201c;My neighbors. My friends. My wife and kids. I knew that <i>all </i>of them wouldn&#x2019;t die. How could <i>all </i>of them die? Some people will get sick, but most people won&#x2019;t, and the rest will get better, right? That&#x2019;s faith. That&#x2019;s what we believed.&#x201d; <br> The man pulls a large hunting knife from his boot and begins to clean the dirt from beneath his nails with its tip. <br> &#x201c;This is faith: You grow up; you go to school. Find a job. Get married. Start a family.&#x201d; Finishing the job on one hand, a nail for each rite of passage, then beginning on the other. &#x201c;Your kids grow up. They go to school. They find a job. They get married. They start a family.&#x201d; <i>Scrape, scrape. Scrape, scrape, scrape. </i>He pushes his hat back with the heel of the hand that wields the knife. &#x201c;I was never what you&#x2019;d call a religious person. Haven&#x2019;t seen the inside of a church in twenty years. But I know what faith is, Fa�ther. I know what it is to believe in something. The lights go out, they come back on. The floodwaters roll in, they roll out again. Folks get sick, they get better. Life goes on. That&#x2019;s true faith, isn&#x2019;t it? Your mumbo-jumbo about heaven and hell, sin and salvation, throw it all out and you&#x2019;re still left with that. Even your biggest church-bashing atheist has faith in that. Life will go on.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; the priest says. &#x201c;Life will go on.&#x201d; <br> The watchman bares his teeth. He jabs the knife toward the priest&#x2019;s chest and snarls, &#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t heard a damn word I&#x2019;ve said. See, this is why I can&#x2019;t stand your kind. You light your can�dles and mumble your Latin spells and pray to a god who isn&#x2019;t there, doesn&#x2019;t care, or is just plain crazy or cruel or both. The world burns and you praise the asshole who either set it or let it.&#x201d; <br> The little priest has raised his hands, the same hands that con�secrated the bread and wine, as if to show the man that they are empty, that he means no harm. <br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t pretend to know the mind of God,&#x201d; the priest begins, lowering his hands. Eyeing the knife, he quotes from the Book of Job: &#x201c;&#x2018;Therefore I have declared that which I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.&#x2019;&#x201d; <br> The man stares at him for a very long, very uncomfortable moment, absolutely still except for his jaw working the already tasteless knob of gum. <br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to be honest with you, Father,&#x201d; he says matter-of-factly. &#x201c;I feel like killing you right now.&#x201d; <br> The priest nods somberly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid that may happen. When the truth hits home.&#x201d; <br> He eases the knife from the man&#x2019;s shaking hand. The priest touches the man&#x2019;s shoulder. <br> The man flinches but doesn&#x2019;t pull away. &#x201c;What is the truth?&#x201d; the man whispers. <br> &#x201c;This,&#x201d; the little priest answers, and drives the knife deep into the man&#x2019;s chest. <br> The blade is very sharp&#x2014;it slides through the man&#x2019;s shirt easily, gliding between the ribs before sinking three inches into the heart. <br> The priest pulls the man to his chest and kisses the top of his head. <i>May God give you pardon and peace. </i><br> It is over quickly. The gum drops from the man&#x2019;s slackened lips, and the priest picks it up and tosses it through the cave&#x2019;s mouth. He eases the man onto the cold stone floor and stands up. The wet knife glimmers in his hand. <i>The blood of the new and everlasting covenant . . . </i><br> The priest studies the dead man&#x2019;s face, and his heart burns with rage and revulsion. The human face is hideous, unendurably gro�tesque. No need to hide his disgust anymore. <br> The little priest returns to the Big Room, following a well-worn path into the main chamber, where the others twitch and turn in restless sleep.

It prickles my skin, and as I make my way through Tokyo&#x2019;s rain-soaked streets to meet up with the Phoenix Riders, I keep looking over my shoulder. People hurry by in a steady stream of colorful umbrellas and business suits, heels and oversize coats. I can&#x2019;t stop imagining their downcast faces all turned in my direction, no matter which way I go.<br> Maybe it&#x2019;s the paranoia that comes with years of being a bounty hunter. <i>You&#x2019;re on a crowded street, </i>I tell myself. <i>No one&#x2019;s following you.</i><br> It&#x2019;s been three days since Hideo&#x2019;s algorithm was triggered. Technically, the world should now be the safest it&#x2019;s ever been. Every single person who has used the new Henka Games contact lenses&#x2014;even just once&#x2014;should now be completely under Hideo&#x2019;s control, rendered unable to break the law or harm another person.<br> Only the few who still use the beta lenses, like me, are unaffected.<br> So, in theory, I shouldn&#x2019;t be worried about someone following me. The algorithm won&#x2019;t let them do anything to hurt me.<br> But even as I think this, I slow down to stare at the long line wrapping around a local police station. There must be hundreds of people. They&#x2019;re all turning themselves in to the authorities for anything and everything unlawful they&#x2019;ve ever done, from unpaid parking tickets to petty theft&#x2014;even murder. It&#x2019;s been like this for the past three days.<br> My attention shifts to a police barricade at the end of the street. They&#x2019;re directing us to detour down a different block. Ambulance lights flash against the walls, illuminating a covered gurney being lifted into the vehicle. I only need to catch a glimpse of officers pointing up at the roof of a nearby building before I figure out what occurred here. Another criminal must have jumped to their death. Suicides like this have been peppering the news.<br> And I helped make all of this happen.<br> I swallow my unease and turn away. There&#x2019;s a subtle but significant blankness in everyone&#x2019;s eyes. They don&#x2019;t know an artificial hand is inside their minds, bending their free will.<br> <i>Hideo&#x2019;s </i>hand.<br> The reminder is enough to make me pause in the middle of the street and close my eyes. My fists clench and unclench, even as my heart lurches at his name. <i>I&#x2019;m such an idiot.</i><br> How can the thought of him fill me with disgust and desire at the same time? How can I stare in horror at this line of people waiting in the rain outside a police station&#x2014;but still blush at my dream of being in Hideo&#x2019;s bed, running my hands along his back? <br> <i>We&#x2019;re over. Forget him. </i>I open my eyes again and continue on, trying to contain the anger beating in my chest.<br> By the time I duck into the heated halls of a Shinjuku shopping center, rain is coming down in wavy sheets, smearing the reflections of neon lights against the slick pavement.<br> Not that the storm is stopping preparations for the upcoming Warcross closing ceremony, which will mark the end of this year&#x2019;s games. With my beta lenses on, I can see the roads and sidewalks color-coded in hues of scarlet and gold. Each Tokyo district is highlighted like this right now, the streets shaded the colors of the most popular team in that neighborhood. Overhead, a lavish display of virtual fireworks is going off, piercing the dark sky with bursts of colored light. Shinjuku district&#x2019;s favorite team is the Phoenix Riders, so the fireworks here are currently forming the shape of a rising phoenix, arching its flaming neck in a cry of victory.<br> Every day over the next week or so, the top ten players of this year&#x2019;s championships will be announced worldwide after a vote by all Warcross fans. Those ten players will compete in a final, all-star tournament during the closing ceremony, and then spend a year as the biggest celebrities in the world before they play again next spring, in the opening ceremony&#x2019;s game. Like the one I once hacked into and disrupted, that upended my entire life and landed me here.<br> People on the streets are proudly dressed up as their top-ten vote this year. I see a few Asher lookalikes sporting his outfit from our championship game in the White World; someone&#x2019;s decked out as Jena, another as Roshan. Still others are arguing heatedly about the Final. There had obviously been a cheat&#x2014;power-ups that shouldn&#x2019;t have been in play.<br> Of course, I had done that.<br> I adjust my face mask, letting my rainbow hair tumble out from underneath my red raincoat&#x2019;s hood. My rain boots squelch against the sidewalk. I have a randomized virtual face laid over my own, so at least people who are wearing their NeuroLink glasses or contacts will look at me and see a complete stranger. For the rare person who isn&#x2019;t, the face mask should cover enough to make me blend in with everyone else wearing masks on the street. <br> &#x201c;<i>Sugoi!</i>&#x201d; someone passing me exclaims, and when I turn, I see a pair of wide-eyed girls grinning at my hair. Their Japanese words translate into English in my view. &#x201c;Wow! Good Emika Chen costume!&#x201d;<br> They make a gesture like they want to take a photo of me, and I play along, putting up my hands in V-for-victory signs. <i>Are you both under Hideo&#x2019;s control, too? </i>I wonder.<br> The girls bob their heads in thanks and move along. I adjust my electric skateboard strapped over my shoulder. It&#x2019;s a good temporary disguise, pretending to be myself, but for someone used to stalking others, I still feel weirdly exposed.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Emi! Almost here?</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Hammie&#x2019;s message appears before me as translucent white text, cutting through my tension. I smile instinctively and quicken my steps.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Almost.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>It would&#x2019;ve been easier, you know, if you&#x2019;d just come with us.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> I cast a glance over my shoulder again. It would&#x2019;ve definitely been easier&#x2014;but the last time I stayed in the same space as my teammates, Zero nearly killed us in an explosion.<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m not an official Rider anymore. People would ask questions if they saw us heading out as a group tonight.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>But you&#x2019;d be safer if you did.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>It&#x2019;s safer if I didn&#x2019;t.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> I can practically hear her sigh. She sends the address of the bar again.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>See you soon.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> I pass through the mall and out the other side. Here, the colorful blocks of Shinjuku shift into the seedy streets of Kabukich&#x14d;, Tokyo&#x2019;s red-light district. I tense my shoulders. It&#x2019;s not an <i>unsafe </i>area&#x2014;certainly not compared to where I came from in New York&#x2014;but the walls are covered with glowing screens featuring the services of beautiful girls and handsome, spiky-haired boys, along with shadier banners I don&#x2019;t want to understand.<br> Virtual models dressed in scanty outfits stand outside bars, beckoning visitors to enter. They ignore me when they realize my profile marks me as a foreigner and turn their attention to the more lucrative Japanese locals navigating the streets.<br> Still, I pick up my pace. No red-light district in the world is safe. <br> I duck into a narrow street on the border of Kabukich&#x14d;. <i>Piss Alley</i>, so this cluster of little walkways is called. The Riders picked it for tonight because it&#x2019;s closed to tourists during the Warcross championship season. Scowling bodyguards in suits stand at the entrances and exits of the alleys, shooing away curious passersby.<br> I take down my disguise for a second so they can see my real identity. One bodyguard bows his head and lets me in.<br> Both sides of the alleys are lined with tiny sake bars and yakitori stands. Through each of their fogged glass doors, I can see the backs of other teams huddled in front of smoking grills, arguing loudly at virtual projections on the walls showing interviews with players. The scent of fresh rain mixes with aromas of garlic, miso, and fried meat.<br> I pull off my raincoat, shake it out, and fold it inside out into my backpack. Then I head to the last stall. This bar is a little bigger than the others, facing a quiet alley blocked off on either side. Its doorway is lit by a row of cheery red lanterns, and men in suits stand in strategic positions around it. One of them notices me and moves aside, ushering me forward.<br> I walk under the lanterns and enter through the sliding glass door. A curtain of warm air envelops me.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Checked into Midnight Sense Bar!</b><br> <b>+500 Points. Daily Score: +950</b><br> <b>Level 36 | &nbsp;N120,064</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> I find myself standing in a cozy room with a handful of filled seats arranged around a bar, where a chef is busy putting out bowls of ramen. He pauses to call out my arrival.<br> A round of greetings hits me as everyone turns in my direction. <br> There&#x2019;s Hammie, our Thief, and Roshan, our Shield. Asher, our Captain, is sitting on one of the stools with his stylish wheelchair folded behind him. Even Tremaine, who technically plays for the Demon Brigade, is here. He keeps his elbows propped up on the bar as he nods at me through the steam rising from his bowl. He&#x2019;s sitting away from Roshan, who&#x2019;s fiddling with a bracelet of prayer beads on his wrist and making a point of ignoring his former boyfriend.<br> My team. My friends. The eerie feeling of being watched subsides as I take in their faces.<br> Hammie waves me over. I slide gratefully into the empty stool beside her. The chef puts down a bowl of ramen before me and steps out to give us privacy. &#x201c;The whole city&#x2019;s celebrating,&#x201d; I mutter. &#x201c;People have no idea what Hideo&#x2019;s done.&#x201d;<br> She starts pulling her curls tight into a thick pouf high on her head. Then she juts her chin at a virtual screen playing footage from the Final against the wall. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re just in time,&#x201d; she replies. &#x201c;Hideo&#x2019;s about to make his announcement.&#x201d;<br> We stare at the screen as Hammie pours me a cup of tea. It now shows a room of reporters with their faces turned toward a massive stage, all waiting impatiently for Hideo to arrive. Kenn, the Warcross creative director, and Mari Nakamura, Henka Games&#x2019; chief operating officer, are already there, whispering to each other.<br> The room on the screen suddenly bursts into commotion as Hideo walks onstage. He straightens the lapels of his suit jacket once as he strides over to join his companions, shaking hands as he goes with his usual cool, careful grace.<br> Even the sight of him onscreen feels as overwhelming as if he&#x2019;d walked right into this bar. All I see is the same boy I&#x2019;ve watched my whole life, the face I&#x2019;d stop to look for at newsstands and take in on TV. I dig my nails into the counter, trying not to show how embarrassingly weak it makes me feel.<br> Hammie notices. She casts me a sympathetic glance. &#x201c;No one expects you to be over him already,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;I know he&#x2019;s trying to take over the world and all, but he still rocks a suit harder than a Balmain catwalk.&#x201d;<br> Asher scowls. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m right here.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t say I wanted to <i>date </i>him,&#x201d; Hammie replies, reaching over to pat Asher&#x2019;s cheek once.<br> I look on as Hideo and Kenn talk in low voices and wonder how much Kenn and Mari know about Hideo&#x2019;s plans. Has the entire company been in on this all along? Is it possible to keep such a thing secret? Would <i>that </i>many people take part in something so awful?<br> &#x201c;As you all know,&#x201d; Hideo begins, &#x201c;a cheat was activated during the Final of this year&#x2019;s championship that benefited one team&#x2014;the Phoenix Riders&#x2014;over the other&#x2014;Team Andromeda. After reviewing the matter with our creative team&#x201d;&#x2014;he pauses to glance at Kenn&#x2014;&#x201c;it seems the cheat was activated not by one of the players, but by an outside party. We&#x2019;ve decided the best way to resolve this, then, is to hold an official rematch between Team Andromeda and the Phoenix Riders, four days from today. This will be followed by the closing ceremony four days later.&#x201d;<br> An instant buzz of conversation fills the room at Hideo&#x2019;s words. Asher leans back and frowns at the screen. &#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s happening,&#x201d; he says to us all. &#x201c;An official rematch. We&#x2019;ve got three days to get ready.&#x201d;<br> Hammie slurps up a mouthful of noodles. &#x201c;An official rematch,&#x201d; she echoes, although there&#x2019;s no enthusiasm in her voice. &#x201c;Never happened in the history of the championships.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Gonna be a lot of Phoenix Rider haters out there,&#x201d; Tremaine adds. Already, a few shouts of &#x201c;Cheaters!&#x201d; can be clearly heard from the other bars outside.<br> Asher shrugs. &#x201c;Nothing we haven&#x2019;t faced before. Isn&#x2019;t that right, Blackbourne?&#x201d;<br> Tremaine&#x2019;s expression is blank. The excitement of the new game is lost on all of us as we continue to stare at the screen. A rematch isn&#x2019;t the big news. If only those reporters knew what Hideo was really doing with the NeuroLink.<br> <i>I&#x2019;m tired of the horror in the world, </i>he&#x2019;d said to me. <i>So I will </i>force <i>it to end.</i><br> &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Roshan begins, rubbing a hand across his face, &#x201c;if Hideo&#x2019;s bothered by anything that&#x2019;s happened in the last few days, he&#x2019;s not showing it.&#x201d;<br> Tremaine&#x2019;s concentrating on something invisible in his view and tapping rapidly against the bar. A few weeks ago, I would&#x2019;ve bristled at being in the same room as him. He still isn&#x2019;t my favorite person, and I keep waiting for him to sneer and call me Princess Peach again, but for now he&#x2019;s on our side. And we can use all the help we can get.<br> &#x201c;Find anything?&#x201d; I ask him.<br> &#x201c;I dug up some solid numbers on how many people have the new lenses.&#x201d; Tremaine sits back and huffs out a sigh. &#x201c;Ninety-eight percent.&#x201d;<br> I could cut the silence in here like a cake. Ninety-eight percent of all users are now controlled by Hideo&#x2019;s algorithm. I think of the long lines, the police tape. The sheer scale of it makes me dizzy.<br> &#x201c;And the other two percent?&#x201d; Asher manages to ask.<br> &#x201c;Is made up of anybody still using the beta test lenses,&#x201d; Tremaine replies, &#x201c;and who haven&#x2019;t switched over yet. Those folks are safe for now.&#x201d; He peers around the bar. &#x201c;Us, of course, and a number of the official players, since we got the beta lenses before the full version went out. A lot of people in the Dark World, I bet. And the tiny number of people worldwide who don&#x2019;t use the NeuroLink at all. That&#x2019;s it. Everybody else is locked in.&#x201d;<br> No one wants to add anything to that. I don&#x2019;t say it out loud, but I know we can&#x2019;t stay on the beta lenses forever. Word on the street is that those lenses will download a patch that converts them into algorithm lenses on the day of the Warcross closing ceremony.<br> That&#x2019;s happening in eight days.<br> &#x201c;Seven days of freedom left,&#x201d; Asher finally says, voicing what we&#x2019;re all thinking. &#x201c;If you want to rob a bank, now&#x2019;s your chance.&#x201d;<br> I glance at Tremaine. &#x201c;Any luck digging up more info about the algorithm itself?&#x201d;<br> He shakes his head and pulls up a screen for all of us to see. It&#x2019;s a maze of glowing letters. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t even find the faintest trace of it. See this?&#x201d; He stops to point at a block of code. &#x201c;The main log-on sequence? Something should be here.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re saying it&#x2019;s impossible that there&#x2019;s an algorithm here,&#x201d; I reply.<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m saying it&#x2019;s impossible, yes. It&#x2019;s like watching a chair float in midair without any wires.&#x201d;<br> It&#x2019;s the same conclusion I came up with over the past few sleepless nights. I&#x2019;d spent them searching every crevice of the NeuroLink.

Like many kids, he was first inspired to become a manga artist in elementary school when he read <i>Dragon Ball</i> by Akira Toriyama. After spending time in art college, he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his story <i>Karakuri</i>. After considering various genres for his next project, Kishimoto decided on a story steeped in traditional Japanese culture. His first version of <i>Naruto</i>, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; his final version, which debuted in <i>Weekly Shonen Jump</i> in 1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in the world. The series would also spawn multiple anime series, movies, novels, video games and more. Having concluded the series in late 2014, Masashi Kishimoto has kept himself busy this year with the sidestory <i>Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring</i> and writing the story for the latest <i>Naruto</i> movie, <i>Boruto: Naruto the Movie</i> both of which will focus on the title character's son, Boruto.</p><h2>101 Hymn Stories: The Inspiring True Stories Behind 101 Favorite Hymns</h2><p>Now with a new cover!

In the eighteenth century, theologian William Paley developed a famous metaphor for creationism: that of the skilled watchmaker. In <em>The Blind Watchmaker</em>, Richard Dawkins crafts an elegant riposte to show that the complex process of Darwinian natural selection is unconscious and automatic. If natural selection can be said to play the role of a watchmaker in nature, it is a blind one&#x2015;working without foresight or purpose.</p><p>In an eloquent, uniquely persuasive account of the theory of natural selection, Dawkins illustrates how simple organisms slowly change over time to create a world of enormous complexity, diversity, and beauty.</p> 22 illustrations</p><p>Richard Dawkins is not a shy man. Edward Larson's research shows that most scientists today are not formally religious, but Dawkins is an in-your-face atheist in the witty British style:<p> </p><blockquote>I want to persuade the reader, not just that the Darwinian world-view happens to be true, but that it is the only known theory that could, in principle, solve the mystery of our existence.</blockquote><p> The title of this 1986 work, Dawkins's second book, refers to the Rev. William Paley's 1802 work, <i>Natural Theology</i>, which argued that just as finding a watch would lead you to conclude that a watchmaker must exist, the complexity of living organisms proves that a Creator exists. Not so, says Dawkins: "All appearances to the contrary, the only watchmaker in nature is the blind forces of physics, albeit deployed in a very special way... it is the <i>blind</i> watchmaker."</p><p> Dawkins is a hard-core scientist: he doesn't just tell you what is so, he shows you how to find out for yourself. For this book, he wrote <i>Biomorph</i>, one of the first artificial life programs. You can check Dawkins's results on your own Mac or PC.</p>The watchmaker belongs to the eighteenth-century theologian William Paley, who made one of the most famous creationist arguments: Just as a watch is too complicated and too functional to have sprung into existence by accident, so too must all living things, with their far greater complexity, be purposefully designed. It was Charles Darwin&#39;s brilliant discovery that put the lie to these arguments. But only Richard Dawkins could have written this eloquent riposte to the creationists. Natural selection - the unconscious, automatic, blind, yet essentially nonrandom process that Darwin discovered - has no purpose in mind. If it can be said to play the role of watchmaker in nature, it is the blind watchmaker. Acclaimed as perhaps the most influential work on evolution written in this century, The Blind Watchmaker offers an engaging and accessible introduction to one of the most important scientific discoveries of all time.</p><h2>Becoming a Woman of Excellence 30th Anniversary Edition (Bible Studies: Becoming a Woman)</h2><p>Society beckons us to succeed&#x2015;to achieve excellence in our appearance, our earning power, our family life.

Both traditional and entirely revolutionary, he was a paradox. He was at once down to earth and reaching toward heaven, grounded in the rich history of the Church while moving toward a new understanding of the world beyond.<br> &nbsp;<br> Globally recognized as an ecumenical teacher, Richard Rohr started out&#x2014;and remains&#x2014;a Franciscan friar. The loving, inclusive life and preaching of Francis of Assisi make him a recognizable and beloved saint across many faith traditions. He was, as Rohr notes, <i>&#x201c;</i>a master of &#x2018;making room for it&#x2019; and letting go of that which was tired or empty.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Francis found an &#x201c;alternative way&#x201d; to follow Jesus, one that disregarded power and privilege and held fast to the narrow path of the Gospel. Rohr helps us look beyond the birdbath image of the saint to remind us of the long tradition founded on his revolutionary, radical, and life-changing embrace of the teachings of Jesus.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rohr draws on Scripture, insights from psychology, and literary and artistic references, to weave together an understanding of the tradition as first practiced by St. Francis. Rohr shows how his own innovative theology is firmly grounded in the life and teaching of this great saint and provides a perspective on how his alternative path to the divine can deepen and enrich our spiritual lives.<br><br><b>The audio edition of this book can be downloaded via Audible.</b></p><p>Fr.

Rohr (<i>Silent Compassion</i>), a Franciscan priest and director of the Center for Action and Contemplation, examines the life of Francis of Assisi, God&#x2019;s &#x201c;holy fool.&#x201d; This is not a biography, however, but rather an examination of themes in Francis&#x2019;s ministry that can help inspire and motivate contemporary people of faith. Francis focused primarily on loving and being in solidarity with the poor, suffering, and outcast. His outwardly focused spirituality does not emphasize pursuing personal piety. In this way, the author posits that Francis serves as a &#x201c;corrective&#x201d; for those who are exceedingly pious or think they can forge their own path to God without community involvement. Simplicity is another key theme in Francis&#x2019; spirituality: simplicity involves placing oneself outside of financial and consumerist desires that offer a false sense of freedom. This Franciscan message is sorely needed in the world, and Rohr&#x2019;s masterful exposition of its treasures offers spiritual salve.&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;<i><b>Publishers Weekly</b></i><br><br> In&nbsp;<i>Eager to Love</i>, [Rohr] reclaims the mysticism inherent in the Franciscan legacy and he offers it as an alternative to the hierarchical, patriarchal and authoritarian Christianity that he suggests has primary responsibility for so much of contemporary agnosticism in the West. ... He claims to want to "reignite the Franciscan revolution," which is universally accessible and inclusive, offering healing and liberation. As such, he is building a bridge between the Christian mystical tradition and estranged seekers of every ilk. ...&nbsp;<i>Eager to Love</i>&nbsp;is neither a biography of Francis nor a history of the Franciscan order, but Rohr's reflections on the best aspects of the Franciscan heritage as lived out by its founder and its early worthies &#x2014; Clare, Bonaventure and Dun Scotus. &#x2014; <b>Dana Greene,&nbsp;<i>National Catholic Reporter</i></b><br><br><br>From the <i>America </i>magazine interview with Richard Rohr:<br><br><b>Why another book on St. Francis when there is already so much on him?</b><br> Well, first of all it isn&#x2019;t a biography on St. Francis, and I don&#x2019;t really talk about him until one of the later chapters. I make that point at the beginning. My emphasis in the book is on what flowed from him, what was validated by him and then toward the end of the book I look at the source: Francis himself. Francis was not a theologian, much less a systematic theologian. But he was an intuitive genius, at least in terms of spiritual things and the gospel.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>Who are you writing for?</b><br> I would say interested but sincere seekers. I don&#x2019;t care if they&#x2019;re in the church or out of the church. I would like to believe that interested but sincere seekers, probably with some degree of education, will read it. Some of the chapters are quite heavy; the one on contemplation is really central. People who haven&#x2019;t done a little homework in these fields will probably jump over some of these heavier chapters because it might be too much for the common reader. I worried about that a bit because I don&#x2019;t want to write for the elite, but neither do I want to make Francis into a lightweight as he&#x2019;s so often been portrayed. So I guess I&#x2019;m shooting at the middle.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>What does the title &#x201c;Eager to Love&#x201d; mean for you?</b><br> As I began writing it, I was wondering what I would title it, and then in reading Bonaventure&#x2014;Bonaventure is the philosopher-theologian who takes Francis&#x2019; intuitive vision and makes a systematic theology and philosophy out of it&#x2014;is where I found it. In my reading of Bonaventure, I don&#x2019;t remember if he actually uses that phrase, but whatever phrase I was reading prompted that image. What Bonaventure saw in Francis and what he desired in himself was an eagerness to love. It wasn&#x2019;t just an intellectual head trip that the gospel for both Francis and Bonaventure was immediately oriented toward love and service in the world. And love of the world and service toward the world. So the phrase came to me and I never changed it after that. The publishers liked it and it stuck.<br><br> Read the entire interview here.</p><h2>Personal &amp; Authentic: Designing Learning Experiences That Impact a Lifetime</h2><p><p><b>As an educator, you have the power to leave a legacy by . . .</b></p><ul><li><strong>Making students&#x2019; learning experiences personal and authentic</strong></li><li><strong>Ensuring that the culture around you is personal and authentic</strong></li><li><strong>Developing and nurturing personal and authentic relationships</strong></li><li><strong><em>Being</em> personal and authentic</strong></li></ul><p>In <strong><em>Personal &amp; Authentic</em></strong>, <strong>Thomas C.

Maybe Keisuke wants something more than a kiss from the fair Koume. Maybe Koume is looking for someone better than Misaki, the local&nbsp;playboy. But what they find in each other over the course of a&nbsp;summer might be far greater than anything they were expecting.&nbsp;<br><br> Their lives are going to change. And this will all transpire before high school exams!</p><p>Inio Asano (born 1980) is considered by many to be one of the biggest new names in manga of the '00's. Debuting in 1998 Asano was immediately thrust into the manga spotlight by earning praise from luminaries such as Naoki Yamamoto and Shin Takahashi. His acsent to stardom was very quick, and regretfully, the young man went into a bit of a slump soon after. But after four years of struggle and soul-searching as an assistant to some of Japan's most artisticly respected comickers, Asano came back to become the voice of the modern Japanese adolescent. <br><br>His breaktrough work SOLANIN captivated the globe earning him recognition in Japan and an Eisner Award nomination in North America. SOLANIN was later adapted into a cultish motion picture further cementing Asano's place amongst outsiders globally. Since 2002 Asano has penned 10 graphic novel series, dozens of short stories, and is now making in-roads as one of Japan's more popular graphic designers. In 2014 his most recent English language release Nishigahara Holograph was selected as one of the best graphic novels of the year by Publishers Weekly, Comics Alliance, Comics Resources, and Good OK Bad.</p><h2>Ukraine and Russia: From Civilized Divorce to Uncivil War</h2><p>D&#39;Anieri explores the dynamics within Ukraine, between Ukraine and Russia, and between Russia and the West, that emerged with the collapse of the Soviet Union and eventually led to war in 2014. Proceeding chronologically, this book shows how Ukraine&#39;s separation from Russia in 1991, at the time called a &#39;civilized divorce&#39;, led to what many are now calling &#39;a new Cold War&#39;. He argues that the conflict has worsened because of three underlying factors - the security dilemma, the impact of democratization on geopolitics, and the incompatible goals of a post-Cold War Europe. Rather than a peaceful situation that was squandered, D&#39;Anieri argues that these were deep-seated pre-existing disagreements that could not be bridged, with concerning implications for the resolution of the Ukraine conflict. The book also shows how this war fits into broader patterns of contemporary international conflict and should therefore appeal to researchers working on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Russia&#39;s relations with the West, and conflict and geopolitics more generally.</p><p>D&#39;Anieri explores the long-term dynamics of international conflict between Ukraine, Russia and the West, revealing the historic roots of the conflict over Ukraine. He demonstrates how the security dilemma, the impact of democratization on geopolitics, and the incompatible goals of a post-Cold War Europe have led to &#39;a new Cold War&#39;.Paul D&#39;Anieri is a Professor of Political Science and Public Policy at the University of California, Riverside.

He is the author of six books: Your God Is Too Safe, Things Unseen, The Holy Wild, The Rest of God, Hidden in Plain Sight, and Spiritual Rhythm.In his fourth book, Christian pastor Buchanan delves into the concept of the Sabbath, by which he means both a day and an attitude. He campaigns persuasively for readers to revive the Sabbath as a refuge from our pervasive and spiritually destructive culture of busyness. Buchanan's prose is fresh and immediate, earnest and self-effacing at the same time. Each chapter is peppered with vivid stories from his own childhood and ministries as well as insightful retellings of biblical narratives. Each chapter also ends with a practicum the author calls a "Sabbath liturgy"&#x2014;something to try out like choreographic notes, "not to be followed slavishly." Indeed, these invitations to put his ideas on living the Sabbath into action are not PowerPoint-style bulleted lists, but brief narrative passages spiced with more stories and engaging insights. The book can be taken as a whole or read piecemeal as rejuvenating brief sermons. It will aid those Christians looking to step off the hamster wheel of modern working lifestyles and find the rest of God&#x2014;not just "actual physical, mental, spiritual rest, but also the rest of God&#x2014;the things of God's nature and presence we miss in our busyness." <i>(Jan. 31)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Parvana&#x2019;s father has died, and her mother, sister, and brother have gone to a faraway wedding, not knowing what has happened to&nbsp;her father. Parvana doesn&#x2019;t know where they are, but sets out alone to find them &#x2014; masquerading as a boy. Her&nbsp;journey only becomes more perilous as the bombs begin to fall. Making her way across the desolate Afghan countryside, she meets other children who are strays from the war: an infant boy in a bombed-out village, a nine-year-old girl who believes she has magical powers over land mines, and a boy with one leg. The children travel together because it is easier than being alone. As they forge their own family in the war zone that Afghanistan has become, their resilience, imagination and luck help them survive. The reissue includes a new cover and map, and an updated author&#x2019;s note and a glossary provide young readers with background and context. All royalties from the sale of this book go to Canadian Women for Women in Afghanistan.

She lives in Simcoe, Ontario.Grade 7-10-This sequel to The Breadwinner (Groundwood, 2001) easily stands alone. After her father's death, 13-year-old Parvana, disguised as a boy, wanders alone through war-torn Afghanistan looking for her mother and siblings who had disappeared in the tumult of the Taliban takeover of Mazar-e-Sharif. Early in her journey, Parvana comes across a baby, the only survivor in a bombed village. She takes him along, as both a burden and comforting company. Taking shelter in a small cave, she discovers an angry one-legged boy who is starved for both food and human companionship. Imagining treasure in their cave, they dig, only to find a cache of bullets-a scene that epitomizes what childhood has become for these young people. The three continue Parvana's search, stopping for a time in an apparent safe haven on the edge of a minefield where an eight-year-old lives with a near-comatose grandmother. When their refuge is destroyed, the four children join a long line of refugees, arriving finally at a camp. A bittersweet ending offers some hope for Parvana and her family, but readers are left with a horrifyingly realistic picture of the effect of war on children. While the reading is not difficult, the grim content cries out for discussion. An unforgettable read.<br><i>Kathleen Isaacs, Edmund Burke School, Washington, DC</i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ballpark Mysteries #5: The All-Star Joker</h2><p>Next up to the plate&#x2014;book #5 in our early chapter book mystery series, where each book is set in a different American ballpark! <br><br>The stars are out in Kansas City . . . the <i>baseball</i> stars, that is!

Concerned about&nbsp;falling coconuts, seagulls, and lobsters, however,&nbsp;he decides to&nbsp;build his own beach.

Through paintings, murals, and friezes, his work is defined by radiant color, fluid lines, floral elements, and mosaic-like patterning.</p><p>With subjects ranging from sensuality and desire to anxiety and despair, all this iridescence is also suffused with feeling. Klimt&#x2019;s numerous images of women, characterized by curvaceous forms, tender flesh, red lips, and flushed cheeks, were particularly charged with passion, at a time when such frank eroticism was still taboo in Viennese upper-middle-class society.</p><p>This book presents a selection of Klimt&#x2019;s work, introducing his pictorial world of decoration and desire, as well as his influence on artists to come.</p></p><p>A Taschen look at Gustav Klimt, man and artist.Gilles N�ret (1933&#x2013;2005) was an art historian, journalist, writer, and museum correspondent.

When I completed filling it out, I gave it back to them. I wish I'd had a book like this to give my parents when they were alive. We didn't talk much at home and sadly the stories are gone. I recommend this book to those with aging parents and at least make a start on family history. --Amazon - Verdene<br><br>Great book! I gave this to my mom for her 70th birthday. There were a few other older family members there and we read the questions aloud and let them all answer. It was fascinating! Like our own history lesson. I only wish we had more time to get through more questions. I told my mom she didn't have to "write in" the answers, but that we could just pick a few questions to discuss over dinners. There are several different sections that ask a series of questions grouped together -- from your childhood, your beliefs, love, world events. Highly recommend. --Amazon - Jennifer Hand<br><br>Wonderful book for new parents.
